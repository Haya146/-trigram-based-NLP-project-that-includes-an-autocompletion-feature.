qatar who hosted the event the tournament will be jointly hosted by canada the united states and mexico which will give mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three world cups history previous international competitions the worlds first international football match was a challenge match played in glasgow in between scotland and england the first international tournament for nations the inaugural british home championship took place in and included games between england scotland wales and ireland as football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the th century it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the and summer olympics however the international olympic committee has retroactively upgraded their status to official events as well as the intercalated games after fifa was founded in it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the olympic framework in switzerland in these were very early days for international football and the official history of fifa describes the competition as having been unsuccessful at the summer olympics in london football became an official olympic sport planned by the football association fa englands football governing body the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition great britain represented by the england national amateur football team won the gold medals they repeated the feat at the summer olympics in stockholm with the olympic event continuing to be a contest between amateur teams only sir thomas lipton organised the sir thomas lipton trophy tournament in turin in the lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs not national teams from different nations each of which represented an entire nation the competition is sometimes described as the first world cup and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from italy germany and switzerland but the fa of england refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team lipton invited west auckland an amateur side from county durham to represent england instead west auckland won the tournament and returned in to successfully defend their title prior to the lipton competition from to games that were considered to be the football world championship were meetings between leading english and scottish clubs such as the game between sunderland afc and the heart of midlothian fc which sunderland won in fifa agreed to recognise the olympic tournament as a world football championship for amateurs and took responsibility for managing the event this paved the way for the worlds first intercontinental football competition for nations at the summer olympics contested by egypt and european teams and won by belgium uruguay won the next two olympic football tournaments in and those were also the first two open world championships as was the start of fifas professional era and is the reason why uruguay is allowed to wear stars world cups before world war ii due to the success of the olympic football tournaments fifa with president jules rimet as the driving force again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the olympics on may the fifa congress in amsterdam decided to stage a world championship with uruguay now twotime official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in fifa named uruguay as the host country of the inaugural world cup tournament the national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team but the choice of uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the atlantic ocean for european sides especially in the midst of the great depression as such no european country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition rimet eventually persuaded teams from belgium france romania and yugoslavia to make the trip in total nations took part seven from south america four from europe and two from north america the first two world cup matches took place simultaneously on july and were won by france and the united states who defeated mexico and belgium respectively the first goal in world cup history was scored by lucien laurent of france in the final uruguay defeated argentina in front of spectators in montevideo and became the first nation to win the world cup after the creation of the world cup fifa and the ioc disagreed over the status of amateur players football was dropped from the summer olympics after the ioc and fifa worked out their differences olympic football returned at the summer olympics but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious world cup the issues facing the early world cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel and war few south american teams were willing to travel to europe for the world cup and all north and south american nations except brazil and cuba boycotted the tournament brazil was the only south american team to compete in both the and competitions which germany and brazil sought to host were cancelled due to world war ii world cups after world war ii the world cup held in brazil was the first to include british football associations scotland england wales and northern ireland had withdrawn from fifa in partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football the teams rejoined in following fifas invitation the tournament also saw the return of champions uruguay who had boycotted the previous two world cups uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation brazil in the match called maracanazo portuguese maracanao in the tournaments between and teams competed in each tournament except in when austria was absorbed into germany after qualifying leaving the tournament with teams and in when india scotland and turkey withdrew leaving the tournament with teams most of the participating nations were from europe and south america with a small minority from north america africa asia and oceania these teams were usually defeated easily by the european and south american teams until the only teams from outside europe and south america to advance out of the first round were united states semifinalists in cuba quarterfinalists in north korea quarterfinalists in and mexico quarterfinalists in expansion to and teams the tournament was expanded to teams in and then to in allowing more teams from africa asia and north america to take part since then teams from these regions have enjoyed more success with several having reached the quarterfinals mexico quarterfinalists in cameroon quarterfinalists in south korea finishing in fourth place in senegal along with usa both quarterfinalists in ghana quarterfinalists in costa rica quarterfinalists in and morocco finishing in fourth place in european and south american teams continue to dominate eg the quarterfinalists in and were all from europe or south america and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far two hundred teams entered the fifa world cup qualification rounds nations attempted to qualify for the fifa world cup a record countries entered qualification for the fifa world cup expansion to teams in october sepp blatter spoke of guaranteeing the caribbean football unions region a position in the world cup in the edition of october of the fifa weekly blatter wrote that from a purely sporting perspective i would like to see globalisation finally taken seriously and the african and asian national associations accorded the status they deserve at the fifa world cup it can not be that the european and south american confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the world cup those two remarks suggested to commentators that blatter could be putting himself forward for reelection to the fifa presidency following the magazines publication blatters wouldbe opponent for the fifa presidency uefa president michel platini responded that he intended to extend the world cup to national associations increasing the number of participants by eight platini said that he would allocate an additional berth to uefa two each to the asian football confederation and the confederation of african football two shared between concacaf and conmebol and a guaranteed place for the oceania football confederation platini was clear about why he wanted to expand the world cup he said the world cup is not based on the quality of the teams because you dont have the best at the world cup but its a good compromise its a political matter so why not have more africans the competition is to bring all the people of all the world if you dont give the possibility to participate they dont improve in october fifa president gianni infantino stated his support for a team world cup in on january fifa confirmed the world cup will have finalist teams fifa corruption case by may the games were under a particularly dark cloud because of the fifa corruption case allegations and

saudi arabian football federation at the st fifa congress on may and prominently backed by former arsenal manager arsne wenger and national federations in africa and asia continental confederations

the fifa womens world cup was first held in in china the womens tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the mens but is growing the number of entrants for the tournament was more than double that of mens football has been included in every summer olympic games except and unlike many other sports the mens football tournament at the olympics is not a toplevel tournament and since an under tournament with each team allowed three overage players womens football made its olympic debut in the fifa confederations cup was a tournament held one year before the world cup at the world cup host nations as a dress rehearsal for the upcoming world cup it is contested by the winners of each of the six fifa confederation championships along with the fifa world cup champion and the host country the first edition took place in and the last edition was played in in march fifa confirmed that the tournament would no longer be active owing to an expansion of the fifa club world cup in fifa also organises international tournaments for youth football fifa u world cup fifa u world cup fifa u womens world cup fifa u womens world cup club football fifa club world cup and football variants such as

cup is held biannually including the year before each womens world cup both tournaments were awarded in a single bidding process on three occasions with the u tournament serving as a dress rehearsal for the larger competition each time and trophy from to the jules rimet trophy was awarded to the world cup winning team it was originally simply known as the world cup or coupe du monde but in it was renamed after the fifa president jules rimet who set up the first tournament in brazils third victory in the tournament entitled them to keep the trophy permanently however the trophy was stolen in and has never been recovered apparently melted down by the thieves after a new trophy known as the fifa world cup trophy was designed the experts of fifa coming from seven countries evaluated the presented models finally opting for the work of the italian designer silvio gazzaniga the new trophy is cm in high made of solid carat gold and weighs kg lb the base contains two layers of semiprecious malachite while the bottom side of the trophy bears the engraved year and name of each fifa world cup winner since the description of the trophy by gazzaniga was the lines spring out from the base rising in spirals stretching out to receive the world from the remarkable dynamic tensions of the compact body of the sculpture rise the figures of two athletes at the stirring moment of victory this new trophy is not awarded to the winning nation permanently world cup winners retain the trophy only until the postmatch celebration is finished they are awarded a goldplated replica rather than the solid gold original immediately afterwards all members players coaches and managers of the top three teams receive medals with an insignia of the world cup trophy winners gold runnersup silver and thirdplace bronze in the edition fourthplace medals were awarded to hosts south korea before the tournament medals were only awarded to the eleven players on the pitch at the end of the final and the thirdplace match in november fifa announced that all members of world cupwinning squads between and were to be retroactively awarded winners medals since winners of the competition are also awarded the right to wear the fifa champions badge up until the time at which the winner of the next competition is decided format qualification since the second world cup in qualifying tournaments have been held to thin the field for the final tournament they are held within the six fifa continental zones africa asia north and central america and caribbean south america oceania and europe overseen by their respective confederations for each tournament fifa decides the number of places awarded to each of the continental zones beforehand generally based on the relative strength of the confederations teams the qualification process can start as early as almost three years before the final tournament and last over a twoyear period the formats of the qualification tournaments differ between confederations usually one or two places are awarded to winners of intercontinental playoffs for example the winner of the oceanian zone and the fifthplaced team from the asian zone entered a playoff for a spot in the world cup from the world cup onwards host nations receive automatic qualification to the final tournament this right was also granted to the defending champions between and but was withdrawn from the fifa world cup onward requiring the champions to qualify brazil winners in were the first defending champions to play qualifying matches final tournament the final tournament format since has had national teams competing over the course of a month in the host nations there are two stages the group stage followed by the knockout stage in the group stage teams compete within eight groups of four teams each eight teams are seeded including the hosts with the other seeded teams selected using a formula based on the fifa world rankings or performances in recent world cups and drawn to separate groups the other teams are assigned to different pots usually based on geographical criteria and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups since constraints have been applied to the draw to ensure that no group contains more than two european teams or more than one team from any other confederation each group plays a roundrobin tournament in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group this means that a total of six matches are played within a group the last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams the top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage points are used to rank the teams within a group since three points have been awarded for a win one for a draw and none for a loss before winners received two points considering six matches in a group each with three possible outcomes win draw loss there are possible final table outcomes for the possible combinations of the four teams points however of the points combinations or of the possible outcomes lead to ties between the second and third places in such case the ranking among these teams is determined by greatest combined goal difference in all group matches greatest combined number of goals scored in all group matches if more than one team remain level after applying the above criteria their ranking will be determined as follows greatest number of points in headtohead matches among those teams greatest goal difference in headtohead matches among those teams greatest number of goals scored in headtohead matches among those teams fair play points defined by the number of yellow and red cards received in the group stage yellow card minus point indirect red card as a result of a second yellow card minus points direct red card minus points yellow card and direct red card minus points if any of the teams above remain level after applying the above criteria their ranking will be determined by the drawing of lots the knockout stage is a singleelimination tournament in which teams play each other in oneoff matches with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary it begins with the round of or the second round in which the winner of each group plays against the runnerup of another group this is followed by the quarterfinals the semifinals the thirdplace match contested by the losing semifinalists and the final on january fifa approved a new format the team world cup to accommodate more teams which was to consist of groups of three teams each with two teams qualifying from each group to form a round of knockout stage to be implemented by on march fifa approved a revised format of the tournament which features groups of four teams each with the top thirdplaced teams joining the group winners and runnersup in a new round of hosts selection process early world cups were given to countries at meetings of fifas congress the locations were controversial because south america and europe were by far the two centres of strength in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat the decision to hold the first world cup in uruguay for example led to only four european nations competing the next two world cups were both held in europe the decision to hold the second of these in france was disputed as the south american countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents both argentina and uruguay thus boycotted the fifa world cup since the fifa world cup to avoid future boycotts or controversy fifa began a pattern of alternating the hosts between the americas and europe which continued until the fifa world cup the fifa world cup hosted jointly by south korea and japan was the first one held in asia and the first tournament with multiple hosts south africa became the first african nation to host the world cup in the fifa world cup was hosted by brazil the first held in south america since argentina and was the first occasion where consecutive world cups were held outside europe the host country is now chosen in a vote by fifas council this is done under an exhaustive ballot system the national football association of a country desiring to host the event receives a hosting agreement from fifa which explains the steps and requirements that are expected from a strong bid the bidding association also receives a form the submission of which represents the official confirmation of the candidacy after this a fifa designated group of inspectors visit the country to identify that the country meets the requirements needed to host the event and a report on the country is produced the decision on who will host the world cup is usually made six or seven years in advance of the tournament there have been occasions where the hosts of multiple future tournaments were announced at the same time as was the case for the and world cups which were awarded to russia and qatar with qatar becoming the first middle eastern country to host the tournament for the and world cups the final tournament was rotated between confederations allowing only countries from the chosen confederation africa in south america in to bid to host the tournament the rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding germanys victory over south africa in the vote to host the tournament however the policy of continental rotation did not continue beyond so any country except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments can apply as hosts for world cups starting from this is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the tournament where brazil was the only official bidder the fifa world cup was chosen to be held in the united states canada and mexico marking the first time a world cup has been shared by three host nations the tournament will be the biggest world cup ever held with teams playing matches sixty matches will take place in the us including all matches from the quarterfinals onward while canada and mexico will host games each summary by confederation performances six of the eight champions have won one of their titles while playing in their own homeland the exceptions being brazil who finished as runnersup after losing the deciding match on home soil in and lost their semifinal against germany in and spain which reached the second round on home soil in england won its only title while playing as a host nation uruguay italy argentina and france won their first titles as host nations but have gone on to win again while germany won their second title on home soil other nations have also been successful when hosting the tournament switzerland quarterfinals sweden runnersup in chile third place in south korea fourth place in russia quarterfinals and mexico quarterfinals in and all have their best results when serving as hosts so far south africa and qatar failed to advance beyond the first round attendance source fifa the bestattended single match has been the final in of the world cups as of another match

tests schedule unlike previous fifa world cups which are typically played in june and july because of qatars intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity the world cup was played in november and december as a result the world cup was unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of many domestic association football leagues which started in late july or august including all of the major european leagues which had been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the world cup major european competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the world cup to avoid playing group matches the following year the match schedule was confirmed by fifa on july the group stage was set to begin on november with four matches every day later the schedule was tweaked by moving the qatar vs ecuador game to november after qatar lobbied fifa to allow their team to open the tournament the final was played on december national day at lusail stadium unlike previous tournaments where the match venues and kickoff times for each fixture were set prior to the draw the assignment of group fixtures for each matchday to a specific venue and kickoff time was only made after the final draw with the teams of each specific fixture known this was due to the close proximity of the venues which allowed the organizers to optimize stadium allocation for spectators and kickoff times for television audiences the matches for each group were allocated to the following stadiums groups a b e f al bayt stadium

by arcom six out of ten french people followed at least one match host selection criticism there have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection process involving fifas executive committee members these allegations are being investigated by fifa see bidding corruption allegations below in may allegations of corruption within the fifa senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the world cup being held in qatar the accusations of corruption were made relating to how qatar won the right to host the event a fifa internal investigation and report cleared qatar of any violation but chief investigator michael j garcia described fifas report on his enquiry as containing numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations in may swiss federal prosecutors opened an investigation into corruption and money laundering related to the and world cup bids in august former fifa president sepp blatter claimed that qatar had used black ops suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the hosting rights some investigations found that qatar sought an edge in securing hosting by hiring a former cia officer turned private contractor kevin chalker to spy on rival bid teams and key football officials who picked the winner in in september a delegation from alghufran tribe lodged a complaint to fifas president to reject the establishment of the world cup in qatar unless its government restored the qatari nationality to all those affected from the tribe and returned land allegedly stolen from them to build the sport facilities in september it was reported that court documents show a transfer of m dollars were sent top people who voted on the world cup host qatar faced strong criticism for the treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the world cup with amnesty international referring to forced labour and poor working conditions while many migrant workers reported having to pay large recruitment fees to obtain employment the guardian newspaper reported that many workers were denied food and water had their identity papers taken away from them and that they were not paid on time or at all making some of them in effect slaves the guardian estimated that up to workers could die from lax safety and other causes by the time the competition was held between and the qatari government adopted new labour reforms to improve working conditions including a minimum wage for all workers and the removal of the kafala system furthermore in november the international labour organization concluded that no rights were violated and made the decision to close the complaint against qatar regarding the alleged violation of migrant workers rights according to amnesty international however living and working conditions of the foreign workers did not improve in the last years qatar was the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a fifa world cup the next smallest by area was switzerland host of the world cup which was more than three times as large as qatar and only needed to host teams instead of qatar also became only the second country not including uruguay and italy hosts of the first two world cups to be awarded a fifa world cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition japan was awarded cohosting rights of the world cup in without ever having qualified for the finals although they qualified for the edition of the eight stadiums used in the tournament six were located in the doha metropolitan area making it the first world cup since in which most of the stadiums were in one city while this decreased the distance that fans and players needed to commute qatar itself struggled to accommodate the numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space due to qatars laws on alcohol consumption world cup organisers announced the creation of designated soberingup zones as an alternative to widescale arrests of intoxicated fans during the world cup qatars world cup chief executive of the supreme committee for delivery and legacy nasser al khater stated that the purpose of the designated soberingup areas was to ensure the fans safety if a fan was sent to the sobering up zone they were permitted to leave when they could display clearheaded behaviour multiple news agencies described the controversy as a cultural clash between social conservatism and islamic morality against the norms of secular western liberal democracies a number of groups and media outlets expressed concern over the suitability of qatar to host the event issues regarding from human rights worker conditions the rights of lgbt fans and the illegality of homosexuality in qatar in december qatar said rainbow flags would be allowed at the fifa world cup qatari officials initially stated that they would not prohibit the display of pride flags at tournament venues although the country still advised lgbt attendees to comply with the countrys modesty and avoid public displays of affection hassan abdulla althawadi chief executive of the countrys world cup bid said that qatar would permit alcohol consumption during the event even though drinking in public was not permitted there were plans to allow the sale of alcohol inside stadiums and at fan villages normally the sale of alcohol is restricted to nonmuslim guests at selected luxury hotels only however in the months preceding the tournament the display of lgbt material and the sale of alcohol were banned the climate conditions caused some to call hosting the tournament in qatar infeasible with initial plans for airconditioned stadiums giving way to a potential date switch from summer to november and december in may sepp blatter who was fifa president at the time of the selection remarked that awarding the world cup to qatar was a mistake because of the extreme heat while addressing delegates from african and asian confederations blatter said allegations of corruption and some of the criticism including those from sponsors were very much linked to racism and discrimination the attendance figures at the matches also came under scrutiny as the reported crowd attendance was more than the stadium capacities despite games having visible empty seats prior to the tournament a reporter for denmarks tv was threatened by security during a live report from the katara cultural village the organising committee apologised stating that they were mistakenly interrupted tony odonoghue of irelands rt also accused qatari police of interrupting him while filming on november the sunday times and the

workers of participants said that the labour changes had improved their lives and that better working conditions are negotiable legislation has also been proposed on the minimum wage summertime worker safety and the election of migrant worker representatives in businesses labour mobility is a result of changes to the kafala system according to sharan burrow general secretary of the international trade union confederation prior to the tournament the new kafala system tranche of law will put an end to kafala and establish a contemporary industrial relations system fifa president gianni infantino has defended qatars decision to host the tournament others have asserted that qatar has a better human rights record than russia and china which were subjected to less harsh criticism for the same problems when hosting important athletic events in the years before the tournament move to november and december owing to the climate in qatar concerns were expressed over holding the world cup in its traditional time frame of june and july in october a task force was commissioned to consider alternative dates and report after the fifa world cup in brazil on february the fifa task force proposed that the tournament be played from late november to late december to avoid the summer heat and also avoid clashing with the winter olympics in february the winter paralympics in march and ramadan in april the notion of staging the tournament in november was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world commentators noted the clash with the christian christmas season was likely to cause disruption whilst there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be fifa executive committee member theo zwanziger said that awarding the event to qatar was a blatant mistake frank lowy chairman of football federation australia said that if the world cup were moved to november and thus upset the schedule of the aleague they would seek compensation from fifa richard scudamore chief executive of the premier league stated that they would consider legal action against fifa because a move would interfere

flights from israel to qatar and temporary diplomatic representation in the country a kosher kitchen under the supervision of rabbi mendy chitrik was open in time for the first match rabbi marc schneier president of the foundation for ethnic understanding said he had never asked the qatari government for cooked food and he had been the only person in communication with the qataris regarding

post match summary reports the fifa world cup was first held in when fifa the worlds football governing body decided to stage an international mens football tournament under the era of fifa president jules rimet who put this idea into place jules rimet was the president of fifa from to rimet was appreciated so much for bringing the idea of fifa to life that the trophy was named the jules rimet cup instead of the world cup trophy the inaugural edition held in was contested as a final tournament of only thirteen teams invited by the organization since then the world cup has experienced successive expansions and format remodeling with its current team final tournament preceded by a twoyear qualifying process involving over teams from around the world daniel limpio international football before the first official international football match was played in in glasgow between scotland and england although at this stage the sport was rarely played outside great britain at the end of the th century games that were considered the football world championship were meetings between leading english and scottish clubs like the game between sunderland afc and the heart of midlothian fc which sunderland won by the twentieth century football had gained ground all around the world and national football associations were being founded the first official international match outside the british isles was played between uruguay and argentina in montevideo in july the fdration internationale de football association fifa was founded in paris on may comprising football associations from france belgium the preceding two teams having played their first national against each other earlier in the month denmark the netherlands spain sweden and switzerland with germany pledging to join as football began to increase in popularity it was contested as an iocrecognized olympic sport at the and summer olympics as well as at the intercalated games before becoming an official fifasupervised olympic competition at the summer olympics organised by englands football association the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition the england national amateur football team won the event in both and there was an attempt made by fifa to organize an international football tournament between nations outside of the olympic framework in and this took place in switzerland these were very early days for international football and the official history of fifa describes the competition as having been a failure with the olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams competitions involving professional teams also started to appear the torneo internazionale stampa sportiva held in turin in was one of the first and the following year sir thomas lipton organized the sir thomas lipton trophy also held in turin both tournaments were contested between individual clubs not national teams each one of which represented an entire nation for this reason neither was really a direct forerunner of the world cup but notwithstanding that the thomas lipton trophy is sometimes described as the first world cup at the expense of its less wellknown italian predecessor in fifa agreed to recognize the olympic tournament as a world football championship for amateurs and took responsibility for organizing the event this led the way for the worlds first intercontinental football competition at the summer olympics won by belgium uruguay won the tournaments in and beginning of the world cup in fifa made the decision to stage their own international tournament the summer olympics held in los angeles did not plan to include football as part of the programme because the sport was not popular in the united states fifa and the ioc also disagreed over the status of amateur players and so football was dropped from the games fifa president jules rimet thus set about organizing the inaugural world cup tournament with uruguay now a twotime official world champion and due to celebrate its centenary of independence in fifa named uruguay as the host country the national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team but the choice of uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the atlantic ocean for the european sides at the time of the great depression no european country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition rimet eventually persuaded teams from belgium france romania hungary and yugoslavia to make the trip in total nations took part seven from south america four from europe and two from north america the first two world cup matches took place simultaneously and were won by france and the united states who beat mexico and belgium respectively the first goal in world cup history was scored by lucien laurent of france four days later the first world cup hattrick was achieved by bert patenaude of the us in the americans win against paraguay in the final uruguay defeated argentina in front of a crowd of people in montevideo to become the first nation to win a world cup the world cup was hosted by italy and was the first world cup to include a qualification stage sixteen teams qualified for the tournament a number which would be retained until the expansion of the finals tournament in uruguay the titleholders from still upset about the poor european attendance at their world cup in boycotted the world cup bolivia and paraguay were also absent allowing argentina and brazil to progress to the finals in italy without having to play any qualifying matches egypt became the first african team to compete but lost to hungary in the first round italy won the tournament becoming the first european team to do so the world cup competition was also held in europe in france much to the consternation of many south americans with uruguay and argentina boycotting for the first time the title holders and the host country were given automatic qualifications following a playoff match against latvia austria had officially qualified for the final round but because of the anschluss in april with germany the austrian national team withdrew with some austrian players being added to the german squad which was eliminated in the first round austrias place was offered to england but they declined this left the finals with nations competing france hosted but for the first time the hosts did not win the competition as italy retained their title beating hungary in the final polish striker ernest willimowski became the first player to score four goals in a world cup game during polands loss against brazil his record was later equalled by other players but was not bettered until years later in the world cup hiatus due to world war ii the fifa world cup was planned to take place in germany officially applied to host the fifa world cup at the rd fifa congress on august in berlin in june brazil also applied to host the tournament the beginning of european hostilities in september prompted further plans for the world cup to be cancelled before a host country was selected the fifa tournament did not take place during world war ii fifa struggled to keep itself afloat and it had no financial or personnel resources with which to plan a peacetime tournament for when hostilities ended when the war ended in it was clear that fifa would have no hope in a single year of planning and scheduling a world cup in fact fifas first meeting was on july around the time the world cup would ordinarily have been played and when it planned the next world cup for no country would host it the only major international tournament in was the south american championship in which argentina beat brazil on february postwar years s competitions resumed with the world cup in brazil which was the first to include british participants british teams withdrew from fifa in partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with and partly as a protest against a foreign influence to football but rejoined in following fifas invitation englands involvement however was not to be a success the english failed to make the final group round in a campaign that included a surprise loss to the united states the tournament also saw the return of champions uruguay who had boycotted the previous two world cups for political reasons eastern european countries such as hungary the soviet union and czechoslovakia did not enter titleholder italy did take part despite the superga air disaster of in which the entire grande torino team many of whom were national team players were killed the world cup was the only tournament not to stage a final tie replacing knockout rounds with two group phases the last match of the second group phase however is sometimes referred to as a final as the group standings meant the winners would be the overall winners uruguay were surprise victors over hosts brazil with a final score of the game would later be known as maracanazo and became champions for the second time this game also held the record for the highest attendance at any sporting match at roughly the world cup held in switzerland was the first to be televised the soviet union did not participate because of their dismal performance at the summer olympics scotland made their first appearance in the tournament but were unable to register a win going out after the group stage this tournament set a number of alltime goalscoring records including highest average goals per game and highestscoring team hungary and most goals in a single match austrias quarterfinal victory over switzerland west germany were the tournament winners defeating olympic champions hungary in the final overturning a deficit in the process with helmut rahn scoring the winner the match is known as the miracle of bern in germany brazil won the world cup held in sweden and became the first team to win a world cup outside their home continent only teams have done this to date brazil in and argentina in and spain in and germany in the soviet union participated this time most likely due to their win at melbourne for the first and so far only time all four british teams qualified for the final round wales was able to take advantage of a situation in the africaasia zone where the number of withdrawals would give israel qualification without having played a single qualifying match this prompted fifa to rule that qualification without playing was not allowed despite allowing this to happen in earlier years of the cup and so israel were ordered to play against one of the teams finishing second in the other groups a tie was created and wales defeated israel twice in it was the first and so far the only time that a country played a world cup final round after having been eliminated in the regular qualifiers the tournament also saw the emergence of pel who scored two goals in the final french striker just fontaine became the top scorer of the tournament s chile hosted the world cup two years before the tournament an earthquake struck the largest ever recorded at magnitude prompting officials to rebuild due to major damage to infrastructure when the competition began two of the best players were in poor form as pel was injured in brazils second group match against czechoslovakia also the soviet union saw their goalkeeper lev yashin show poor form including a loss to hosts chile as the hosts captured third place the competition was also marred by overly defensive and often violent tactics this poisonous atmosphere culminated in what was known as the battle of santiago first round match between italy and chile in which chile won prior to the match two italian journalists wrote unflattering articles about the host country in the match players on both sides made deliberate attempts to harm opponents though only two players from italy were sent off by english referee ken aston in the end the italian team needed police protection to leave the field in safety when the final whistle blew brazil beat czechoslovakia for the second world cup in a row by a final of led by garrincha and amarildo in pels absence and retained the jules rimet trophy colombias marcos coll made world cup history when he scored a goal direct from a corner kick called an olympic goal in latin america the only one ever made in a world cup past legendary soviet goalkeeper lev yashin the world cup hosted by england was the first to embrace marketing featuring a mascot and official logo for the first time the trophy was stolen in the runup to the tournament but was found a week later by a dog named pickles south africa was banned for violating the antidiscrimination charter apartheid the ban remained in effect until when the south africa football association was finally accepted by fifa the qualifying rounds of the tournament saw a controversy when the african nations decided to withdraw in protest of only one qualifying place allocated by fifa to the regions of asia oceania and africa the eventual qualifiers from the zone north korea became the first asian team to reach the quarterfinals eliminating italy in the process england won the tournament although joo havelange former fifa president from to claimed that the and world cups were fixed so that england and germany would win respectively geoff hurst became the first player to score a hattrick in a world cup final and eusbio whose team portugal were taking part in their first world cup was the tournament topscorer with nine goals to his name s the qualification stages of the world cup were coincidental with the football war between honduras and el salvador the finals were held in mexico israel had been with europe but due to political issues it was becoming harder to place them adequately in the qualifying rounds they were grouped in asiaoceania korea dpr then refused to meet them even though this meant automatic disqualification the group stage clash between defending champions england and brazil lived up to its billing and is still remembered for england goalkeeper gordon banks save from a pel header on the sixyard line the tournament is also remembered for the semifinal match between italy and west germany in which five goals were scored in extra time and franz beckenbauer played with a broken arm since germany had used up all their allowed substitutions italy were the eventual winners but were defeated in the final by brazil who became the first nation to win three world cups and were awarded the jules rimet trophy permanently for their achievement a new trophy was created for the edition held in west germany after a draw in their first uefaconmebol intercontinental playoff match against chile in the qualifiers the soviet union refused to travel to the chilean capital for the return fixture

two top teams from each of the earlier four groups were divided into two groups of four each again the winner of either group playing each other in the final the west german hosts won the competition by beating the netherlands in the final but it was also the revolutionary total football system of the dutch that captured the footballing worlds imagination the very wellplaying poland finished third

argentina causing controversy as a military coup had taken place in the country two years earlier allegations that dutch star johan cruyff refused to participate because of political convictions were refuted by him years later and none of the teams decided to stay away this was the hardest ever world cup to qualify for with countries vying for places the holders and hosts qualified automatically there were nearly seven teams competing for each place in argentina hungary won their european group but still had to win a playoff against bolivia to qualify while england and italy the only former champions involved in european qualifying were placed in the same group with the result that england were eliminated on goal difference despite winning five of their six qualifying matches iran and tunisia were firsttime participants tunisia won their first match against mexico and became the first african team to ever win a world cup game there was some onfield controversy as well during the second round argentina had an advantage in their match against peru since the kick off was several hours after brazils match with poland brazil won their match so argentina knew that they had to beat peru by four goals to advance to the final trailing at halftime peru simply collapsed in the second half and argentina eventually won rumors suggested that peru might have been bribed into allowing argentina to win the match by such a large margin argentina went on to win the final with the dutch being runnersup for the second time in a row late th century s spain hosted an expanded world cup which featured teams the first expansion since the teams were divided into six groups of four with the top two teams in each group advancing to the second round where they split into four groups of

incident as the french were leading the kuwaiti team stopped playing after hearing a whistle from the stands which they thought had come from referee as french defender maxime bossis scored as the kuwaiti team were protesting the goal sheikh fahid alahmad alsabah president of the kuwait football association rushed onto the pitch and gave the referee a piece of his mind who proceeded to disallow the goal bossis scored another valid goal a few minutes later and france won also during the group stages hungary beat el salvador which has been the only occasion to this day that a team scored ten goals in a world cup match the group match between west germany and austria later resulted in a change of world cup rules after both teams visibly aimed to keep the qualification ensuring scoreline

card and germany won in a penalty shootout after coming back to level from having gone down the final was won by italy making italian captain dino zoff the oldest player to win the world cup italian

format of each final tournament have varied considerably over the years in most tournaments the tournament consists of a roundrobin group stage followed by a singleelimination knockout stage notes in and draws in knockout matches were resolved via a replay later drawing of lots was provided for though never invoked since penalty shootouts are used in each group had two seeded and two unseeded teams the seeded teams played only unseeded teams and vice versa up to ranking ties in groups were to be broken via a playoff this only happened in and until the fifa world cup points were conceded for a win and point was conceded for a draw since the fifa world cup points are conceded for a win and point is conceded for a draw each group of four teams plays a roundrobin schedule as of the world cup all final group games must be held simultaneously a rule instituted by fifa to minimize collusion amongst teams requiring a certain result to advance fifa instituted a policy to award three points for a win in the world cup although goals for was already a tiebreaker fifa hoped to create an additional incentive for teams to pursue victory the first team affected by the rule was paraguay in which would have won its group on goal differential over nigeria under prior fifa rules paraguay advanced to the knockout phase as group runnerup and was defeated by host nation and eventual champion france in the round of it is not possible under the new point system to be eliminated from the group stage with a second place or higher winning percentage however it is possible to finish behind a team with the same winning percentage yet a lower goal difference this took place in the world cup when new zealand finished with three draws and slovakia finished with one win one draw and one loss slovakia advanced in group f by finishing second with four points eliminating new zealand with three points under the previous fifa point allotment system new zealand would have advanced with a zero goal difference while slovakia would have been eliminated with a goal difference of the criteria for advancement to knockout phase is as follows greatest number of points in group matches greatest total goal difference in the three group matches greatest number of goals scored in the three group matches if teams remained level after those criteria a minigroup would be formed from those teams who would be ranked on most points earned in matches against other teams in the tie greatest goal difference in matches against other teams in the tie greatest number of goals scored in matches against other teams in the tie if teams remained level after all these criteria fifa would hold a drawing of lots the drawing of lots for tied teams takes place one hour after the final game in the

first and only goal of the tournament while also making him the secondhighest international goalscorer of all time argentina eventually won the final against colombia setting messi with total appearances in the tournament while also marking argentinas second consecutive copa amrica win and third consecutive international tournament title with messi as captain player profile style of play due to his short stature messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players which gives him greater agility allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles this has led the spanish media to dub him la pulga atmica the atomic flea despite being physically unimposing he possesses significant upperbody strength which combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting his short strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed his former barcelona manager pep guardiola once stated messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mids messi is predominantly a leftfooted player with the outside of his left foot he usually begins dribbling runs while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists a prolific goalscorer messi is known for his finishing positioning quick reactions and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line he also functions in a playmaking role courtesy of his vision and range of passing he has often been described as a magician a conjurer creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist moreover he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker as of september messi ranks fifth all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with the most among active players he also has a penchant for scoring from chips messis pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal in particular during counterattacks usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch he is widely considered to be one of the greatest dribblers of all time with regard to this ability his former argentina manager diego maradona has said of him the ball stays glued to his foot ive seen great players in my career but ive never seen anyone with messis ball control beyond his individual qualities he is also a wellrounded hardworking team player known for his creative combinations in particular with former barcelona midfielders xavi and andrs iniesta as his career advanced and his athleticism and tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history his workrate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed by covering less ground on the pitch and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed he was able to improve his efficiency movement and positional play and was also able to avoid muscular injuries despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis indeed while he was injuryprone in his early career he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball and by adopting a stricter diet training regime and sleep schedule tactical positioning tactically messi plays in a free attacking role a versatile player he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch his favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers known as the enganche in argentine football but he began his career in spain as a leftwinger or leftsided forward upon his firstteam debut he was moved onto the right wing by manager frank rijkaard from this position he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates under guardiola and subsequent managers he most often played in a false nine role positioned as a centreforward or lone striker he would roam the centre often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him in order to create and exploit spaces for passes other teammates attacking runs off the ball messis own dribbling runs or combinations with xavi and iniesta under the stewardship of luis enrique messi initially returned to playing in the rightsided position that characterised much of his early career in the managers formation while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper free playmaking role in later seasons under manager ernesto valverde messi played in a variety of roles while he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role from which he could make runs from behind into the box or even on the right wing or as a false nine he was also used in a more offensive central role in a or as a second striker in a formation where he was once again given the licence to drop deep linkup with midfielders orchestrate his teams attacking plays and create chances for his attacking partner luis surez with the argentina national team messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline under various managers he has been employed on the right wing as a false nine as an outandout striker in a supporting role alongside another forward or in a deeper free creative role as a classic number playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers reception messi is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation alongside portuguese forward cristiano ronaldo and one of the greatest footballers of all time a prodigious talent as a teenager messi established himself among the worlds best players before age shortly after teammate ronaldinho won the ballon dor he commented im not even the best at bara in reference to his yearold protg four years later after messi won his first ballon dor by a record margin the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history an early proponent was his thenbarcelona manager pep guardiola who as early as august declared messi to be the best player he had ever seen in the following years this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits managers former and current players and by the end of baras second treblewinning season the view of messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental europe he initially received dismissals by critics based on the fact that he had not won an international tournament at senior level with argentina however messis subsequent victories in the copa amrica and the fifa world cup resulted in him finally winning every top tier trophy at both the club and country levels an achievement that many pundits felt cemented his legacy comparisons with cristiano ronaldo among his contemporary peers messi is most often compared and contrasted with cristiano ronaldo who many consider his career rival both achieved numerous individual accolades won dozens of trophies for both club and country and are the two leading goal scorers in history although messi has at times denied any rivalry they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world pundits have compared the ongoing rivalry to past sports rivalries like the muhammad alijoe frazier rivalry in boxing the prostsenna rivalry in motorsport and the tennis rivalries between federernadal and borgmcenroe fans and pundits alike regularly argue the individual merits of both players messi is lauded for his combination of dribbling playmaking passing and goalscoring while ronaldo has received praise for his exceptional speed and athleticism goalscoring skills and performance under pressure beyond their playing styles the debate also revolves around their differing physiques ronaldo is m ft in with a muscular build compared to messis smaller size and contrasting public personalities with ronaldos selfconfidence and theatrics a foil to messis humility regarding individual achievements messi has won eight ballons dor to ronaldos five eight fifa worlds best player awards to ronaldos five and six european golden shoes to ronaldos four off the pitch ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary sponsorships and social media fanbase messis headtohead record against teams that feature ronaldo consists of wins draws and losses in competitive club matches win and loss in international friendlies and win in a club friendly the first competitive matchup between the two occurred in when ronaldos manchester united were drawn to play messis barcelona in the uefa champions league semifinals where manchester united would eventually advance on aggregate the two teams and subsequently the two players would meet in the champions league again the next year this time in the final with this time messi and barcelona being the victors after a result after this ronaldo would transfer to real madrid the main rivals of barcelona and from to messi faced ronaldo at least twice every season in el clsico which ranks among the worlds most viewed annual sports events ronaldos would then transfer to juventus in the summer of their final matchup in a competitive match would occur during a uefa champions league group stage match where ronaldos two goals from the penalty spot helped juventus to a victory against messis barcelona after ronaldo left real madrid for juventus messi stated i miss cristiano although it was a bit difficult to see him win trophies he gave la liga prestige following messi leading argentina to victory in the world cup a number of football critics commentators and players have opined that messi settled the debate between the two players comparisons with diego maradona throughout his career messi has been compared with his compatriot diego maradona who was also considered the best player of his generation and one of greatest in the history of the sport this was due to their short statures their similar playing styles as diminutive leftfooted playmakers and the fact that they both came from argentina initially messi was merely one of many young argentine players to receive the new maradona moniker but as his career progressed messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders establishing himself as the best player argentina had produced since maradona even when messi was years old maradona called him the best player in the world and hailed him as his successor maradona and messi would work together as manager and player for argentinas national side from through the fifa world cup the former thoroughly impressed with the latters skills it was during this period that messi was given argentinas number shirt that maradona famously wore maradona gave messi his blessing telling him the no is yours theres nobody better than you to wear it during the early and middle parts of his career messi was generally held in lesser esteem than maradona in argentine society part of this had to do with messis lack of tournament success and perceived uneven output with the national team during this period maradona had famously led argentina to victory in the fifa world cup with a dominant overall performance which set expectations for messi to do the same also unlike maradona messi never played in the argentine primera divisin therefore depriving his countrymen a chance to watch him develop and prove himself and through no fault of his own would do this overseas in la liga instead argentines also identified more with the fiery and controversial maradona who came from the slums character traits that they felt aligned with their national values as opposed to the reserved and unassuming messi who had a comparable unremarkable upbringing in rosario several pundits footballing figures and maradona himself would point to this temperament to question messis leadership capabilities for the national team furthermore messis lack of outward passion for the albiceleste shirt early tendency not to sing the national anthem and disinclination to emotional displays have in the past led to the false perception that he felt more catalan rather than truly argentine however despite having lived in barcelona since age messi rejected the option of representing spain internationally saying argentina is my country my family my way of expressing myself i would change all my records to make the people in my country happy football journalist tim vickery stated the perception of messi among argentines changed in with messi making a conscious effort to become more one of the group more argentine other pundits noted that messi had grown more assertive as a leader during the copa amrica by becoming more vocal with his teammates both on and off the pitch finally singing the national anthem with the team before matches and speaking with journalists at length after matches the latter of which he rarely did for barcelona following the world cup win for messi and argentina vickery felt that messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as maradona former footballer turned journalist jorge valdano said he saw a maradonian edge to messis performances while compatriot osvaldo ardiles mentioned that messis provoking actions against the netherlands side during the quarterfinal were more of a maradona reaction further endearing messi to his countrymen messi himself later remarked that the world cup victory won over all the people of argentina today or of argentines love me and thats a beautiful feeling in popular culture popularity messi was among the time an annual list of the worlds most influential people in and according to a survey in international markets messi was familiar to of respondents around the world of whom perceived him favourably making him the secondmost recognised player globally behind ronaldo and the most likable of all contemporary players world press photo

versatile attacker ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch and while ostensibly rightfooted is very strong with both feet tactically ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career while at sporting and during his first season at manchester united he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area in this position he was able to use his pace and acceleration agility and technical skills to take on opponents in oneonone situations ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair often displaying an array of tricks and feints such as the step overs and socalled chops that became his trademark he has also been known to use the flipflap his strength and jumping ability combined with his elevation heading accuracy and height of m ft in give him an edge in winning aerial duels these attributes allow him to function as

saying all eyes on me and this is going in he understands the marketing side of it the way he struts up and places it the world is watching him at real madrid ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role while his creative and defensive duties became more limited although not entirely diminished initially deployed as a centre forward by managers manuel pellegrini and jos mourinho he was later moved back onto the left wing though in a free tactical role this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit madrids counterattacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player as evidenced by his recordbreaking goalscoring feats while he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role this unique role has been described by pundits as that of a false attacking or goalscoring winger as ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area despite actually

or formation in which he often switched positions with mario manduki in this role he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball and be more involved in the buildup of plays as such aside from scoring goals himself he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with real madrid off the ball he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates crosses on occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside manduki in a or formation he continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager

wing which is often considered one of the best goals ever scored uefa euro was held in sweden and was won by denmark who had been invited to the finals after un sanctions prevented yugoslavias participation as some of the states constituting the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia were at war with each other the danes beat holders the netherlands on penalties in the semifinals then

torres became the first player to score in two european championship finals he was equal top scorer for the tournament with three goals in total along with mario balotelli alan dzagoev mario gmez mario manduki and cristiano ronaldo despite only being used as a substitute player the tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a euro tournament out of goals in total a disallowed goal in the england versus ukraine group game which replays showed had crossed the goal line and which prompted president of fifa sepp blatter to tweet glt goalline technology is no longer an alternative but a necessity thus reversing his longheld reluctance to embrace such technology and some crowd violence in group games expansion to teams in the football association of ireland and scottish football association proposed the expansion of the tournament which was later confirmed by the uefa executive committee in september out of the member associations of uefa only three

july the competition was postponed in order to reduce pressure on the public services in affected countries and to provide space in the calendar for the completion of domestic leagues that had been suspended before the euro dublin was also removed as one of the host cities due to its inability to guarantee spectators to the stadium while bilbao was replaced by seville for the same reason in the final italy defeated maiden finalists england on penalties after the game was tied after extra time to win their second european championship trophy the henri delaunay trophy which is awarded to the winner of the european championship is named in honour of henri delaunay the first general secretary of uefa who came up with the idea of a european championship but died five years before the first

trophy bore the words coupe deurope european cup coupe henri delaunay henri delaunay cup and championnat deurope european championship on the front and a juggling boy on the back for the tournament

and did the same in the edition when germany and portugal received bronze medals however uefa decided that losing semifinalists would no longer receive medals from the edition onwards bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place playoff the last of which was held in format the competition before only four teams qualified for the final tournament from eight teams competed in the tournament expanded to teams since it was easier for european nations to qualify for the world cup than their own continental championship of the teams at the and world cups had been european whereas the european championship finals still involved only eight teams in there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to teams started by scotland and the republic of ireland due to the increased number of football associations in europe after the breakups of czechoslovakia yugoslavia and the soviet union and the inclusion of israel and kazakhstan the new president of uefa michel platini was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption whilst on april uefas executive committee formally decided against expansion in platini indicated in june

the direct qualifying spots or win a playoff after this a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically the groups for qualification are drawn by a uefa committee using seeding seeded teams include reigning champions and other teams based on their performance in the preceding fifa world cup qualifying and the last european championship qualifying to obtain an accurate view of the teams abilities a ranking is produced this is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played ie points per game in the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used if two teams have equal points per game the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition average goal difference average number of goals scored average number of away goals scored drawing of lots the qualifying phase is played in a group format the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from predefined seeded bowls the draw takes place after the preceding world cups qualifying competition for uefa euro the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each each group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away the top two teams then qualified for the final tournament with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the uefa nations league as with most leagues the points are awarded as three for a win one for a draw and none for a loss in the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question results of all group matches superior goal difference higher number of goals

and ukraine the winners and the highest ranked secondplaced team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four playoff matches between the runnersup of the other groups these sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups a b c and d each consisting of four teams the groups were drawn up by the uefa administration again using seeding the seeded teams being the host nations the reigning champions should they qualify and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous world cup qualifying other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw using coefficients as a basis for the tournament the expansion to teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four with the six group winners six group runnersup and the four best thirdplaced teams advancing to the round of when it becomes a knockout competition the groups are again played in a league format where a team plays its opponents once each the same points system is used three points for a win one point for a draw no points for a defeat a schedule for the group matches will be drawn up but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously the winner and runnerup of each group progress to the next round where a knockout system is used the two teams play each other once the winner progresses this is used in all subsequent rounds as well the winners of the quarterfinals matches progress to the semifinals where the winners play in the final if in any of the knockout rounds the scores are still equal after normal playing

fans format qualification the uefa champions league used to begin with a double roundrobin group stage of teams until it evolved into a league phase of teams which is preceded by two qualification streams for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper the two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions and those qualified by virtue of finishing second third or fourth in their national championship the number of teams that each association enters into the uefa champions league is based upon the uefa coefficients of the member associations these coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five champions league europa league and conference league seasons the higher an associations coefficient the more teams represent the association in the champions league and the fewer qualification rounds the associations teams must compete in five of the remaining seven qualifying places are granted to the winners of a fourround qualifying tournament between the remaining or national champions within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds the other two are granted to the winners of a threeround qualifying tournament between ten and eleven clubs from the associations ranked through which have qualified based upon finishing second third or fourth in their respective national league in addition to sporting criteria any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the champions league to obtain a license the club must meet certain stadium infrastructure and finance requirements in liverpool and artmedia bratislava became the first teams to reach the champions league group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds real madrid and barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage having qualified times followed by porto and bayern munich on between and no differentiation was made between champions and nonchampions in qualification the topranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage prior to this three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams with teams starting in different rounds an exception to the usual european qualification system happened in after liverpool won the champions league the year before but did not finish in a champions league qualification place in the premier league that season uefa gave special dispensation for liverpool to enter the champions league giving england five qualifiers uefa subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing however for those leagues with four entrants in the champions league this meant that if the champions league winner fell outside of its domestic leagues top four it would qualify at the expense of the fourthplaced team in the league until no association could have more than four entrants in the champions league in may tottenham hotspur finished fourth in the premier league two places ahead of chelsea but failed to qualify for the champions league after chelsea won the final tottenham were demoted to the uefa europa league in may it was decided that starting from the season and continuing at least for the threeyear cycle until the season the winners of the previous seasons uefa europa league would qualify for the uefa champions league entering at least the playoff round and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the champions league title holders was not used the previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five meaning that a fourthplaced team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the europa league if both the champions league and europa league winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league in michel platini the uefa president had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nations cup winners this proposal was rejected in a vote at a uefa strategy council meeting in the same meeting however it was agreed that the thirdplaced team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage rather than entry into the third qualifying round while the fourthplaced team would enter the playoff round for nonchampions guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top leagues in europe this was part of platinis plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lowerranked nations in the group stage in arsne wenger referred to qualifying for the champions league by finishing in the top four places in the premier league as the th place trophy the phrase was coined after a prematch conference when he was questioned about arsenals lack of a trophy after exiting the fa cup he said the first trophy is to finish in the top four at arsenals agm wenger was also quoted as saying for me there are five trophies every season premier league champions league the third is to qualify for the champions league league phase and knockout phase beginning with the season uefa changed the format of their three club competitions abandoning the group stage in favour of an expanded league phase the number of participating teams was increased from to teams teams are no longer divided into groups of four teams each but are ranked in a single table each team plays eight matches against eight different opponents for the draw of the league phase teams are divided into four seeding pots according to their uefa coefficient each team will play against two teams from each pot one home and one away the league phase is played from september to january while the knockout phase begins in february with matches predominantly played on tuesday and wednesday nights after the league phase a twolegged knockout playoff round is played between teams finishing seeded and unseeded in the league phase teams finishing in the top eight of the league phase receive a bye to the round of as seeded teams while the eight winning teams from the knockout playoff round will enter the round of draw as unseeded teams teams finishing thth place in the league phase and the eight losers of the knockout playoffs are eliminated from the competition and from european football since it is no longer possible to enter the europa league from the league phase onwards after the round of the competition follows the traditional knockout format with quarterfinals semifinals both two legged and without association draw protection and then the final at a venue chosen prior to the season the final is typically held in late may or early june prior to the season the tournament proper began with a group stage of teams divided into eight groups of four the draw to determine which teams entered each group was seeded based on each teams uefa coefficient and no group could contain more than one club from each association each team played six group stage games meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a roundrobin format the first place team and the runnersup from each group then progressed to the next round the thirdplaced teams entered the europa leagues knockout round and the fourthplaced teams were eliminated from the competition for the next stage the last the winning team from one group played against the runnersup from another group but teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other see random twosided matching from the quarterfinals onwards the draw was entirely random without association protection the group stage was played from september to december whilst the knockout stage began in february with matches usually played on tuesday and wednesday nights the knockout ties were played in a twolegged format with the exception of the final in the season due to the covid pandemic the tournament was suspended for five

such as red grey and black have also been used a change from black to red came in on the request of jrgen klinsmann but germany played every game at the world cup in its home white colours in the away

patience and possession above all else the style involves roaming movement and positional interchange amongst midfielders moving the ball in intricate patterns and sharp one or twotouch passing tikitaka is both defensive and offensive in equal measure the team is always in possession so doesnt need to switch between defending and attacking commentators have contrasted tikitaka with route one physicality and with the highertempo passing of barcelona and arsne wengers arsenal side which employed cesc fbregas as the only channel between defence and attack tikitaka is associated with flair

association a return fixture was organised by representatives of scottish football teams on november this match played at hamilton crescent in scotland is viewed as the first official international football match because the two teams were independently selected and operated rather than being the work of a single football association over the next years england played exclusively with the other three home nationsscotland wales and irelandin the british home championship at first england had no permanent home stadium they joined fifa in and played their first games against countries other than the home nations on a tour of central europe in wembley stadium was opened in and became their home ground the relationship between england and fifa became strained and this resulted in their departure from fifa in before they rejoined in as a result they did not compete in a world cup until in which they were beaten in a defeat by the united states failing to get past the first round in

temporary charge of england for a sevenmatch spell until don revie was appointed as new permanent manager in under revie the team underperformed and failed to qualify for either euro or the world cup revie resigned in and was replaced by ron greenwood under whom performances improved the team qualified for euro without losing any of their games but exited in the group stage of the final tournament they also qualified for the world cup in spain despite not losing a game they were eliminated at the second group stage bobby robson managed england from to although the team failed to qualify for euro they reached the quarterfinals of the world cup losing to argentina in a game made famous by two highly contrasting goals scored by diego maradona the first being blatantly knocked in by his hand prompting his hand of god remark the second being an outstandingly skilful individual goal involving high speed dribbling past several opponents england striker gary lineker finished as the tournaments top scorer with six goals england went on to lose every match at euro they next achieved their second best result in the world cup by finishing fourth losing again to west germany after a closely contested semifinal finishing after extra time then in englands first penalty shootout despite losing to italy in the third place playoff the members of the england team were given bronze

role for a relatively brief period graham taylor was robsons immediate successor england failed to win any matches at euro drawing with tournament winners denmark and later with france before being eliminated by host nation sweden the team then failed to qualify for the world cup after losing a controversial game against the netherlands in rotterdam which resulted in taylors resignation taylor faced much newspaper criticism during his tenure for his tactics and team selections between and terry venables took charge of the team hosting euro they equalled their best performance at a european championship reaching the semifinals as they did in before exiting via another penalty shootout loss to germany england striker alan shearer was the tournaments top scorer with five goals at euro the song three lions by baddiel skinner and the lightning seeds became the definitive anthem for fans on the terraces and popularised the chant its coming home venables announced before the tournament that he would resign at the end of it following investigations into his personal financial activities and ahead of upcoming court cases due to the controversy around him the fa stressed that he was the coach not the manager of the team venables successor glenn hoddle took the team to the world cup in which england were eliminated in the second round again by argentina and again on penalties after a draw in february hoddle was sacked by the fa due to controversial comments he had made about disabled people to a newspaper howard wilkinson took over as caretaker manager for two matches

eriksson would leave the role following that years world cup steve mcclaren was selected to succeed eriksson but was sacked on november after just matches in charge as england failed to qualify for

whose mistake lead to croatias first goal fabio capello roy hodgson and sam allardyce on december italian manager fabio capello was appointed as mcclarens successor becoming only the second foreign coach to take the job at the world cup england were considered favourites to top their group but drew their opening two games against the united states and algeria this led to questions about the teams spirit tactics and ability to handle pressure despite this england progressed to the round of where they were beaten by germany their heaviest defeat in a world cup finals tournament match this match became infamous for a ghost goal when frank lampard hit a shot from outside the penalty area that bounced down off the crossbar and over the goal line before being cleared by german goalkeeper manuel neuer with neither the referee nor the assistant opting to award a goal had it been given the goal would have tied the game with england coming from two goals down this incident along with similar mistakes at the tournament lead to an apology from fifa president sepp blatter and was a factor in the subsequent decision to introduce goalline technology into football capello continued as england manager leading the teams successful qualifying campaign for euro before resigning from the role in february following a disagreement with the fa over their request to remove john terry from the team captaincy following accusations of racial abuse against the player following capellos departure stuart pearce was appointed as caretaker manager for one match after which in may roy hodgson

although englands first away kits were blue englands traditional away colours are red shirts white shorts and red socks in englands away kit was changed to grey shirts shorts and socks this kit was only worn three times including against germany in the semifinal of euro but the deviation from the traditional red was unpopular with supporters and the england away kit remained red until when a

football club stadiums the original empire stadium was built in wembley london for the british empire exhibition england played their first match at the stadium in against scotland and for the next

subsidiary wembley national stadium limited rivalries englands three main rivalries are with scotland germany and argentina smaller rivalries with france wales and the republic of ireland have also been observed englands rivalry with scotland is one of the fiercest international rivalries that exists it is the oldest international fixture in the world first played in at hamilton crescent glasgow the history of the british isles has led to much rivalry between the nations in many forms and the social and cultural effects of centuries of antagonism and conflict between the two has contributed to the intense nature of the sporting contests scottish nationalism has also been a factor in the scots desire to defeat england above all other rivals with scottish sports journalists traditionally referring to the english as the auld enemy the footballing rivalry has diminished somewhat since the late s particularly since the annual fixture stopped in for england games against germany and argentina are now considered to be more important than the historic rivalry with scotland englands rivalry with germany is considered to be mainly an english phenomenonin the runup to any competition match between the two teams many uk newspapers will print articles detailing results of previous encounters such as englands win in and the semifinal penalty shootout defeats of and euro this rivalry has diminished significantly in recent years germans consider italy the netherlands and france to be their greater rivals and barney ronay of the guardian wrote in that the rivalry with england isnt a close rivalry at all not if we accept the standard definition that both sides need to be aware that it exists germany have won seven major tournaments germany have reached semifinals since the one world cup of englands rivalry with argentina is highly competitive games between the two teams even those that are only friendly matches are often marked by notable and sometimes controversial incidents such as the hand of god in the rivalry is unusual in that it is an intercontinental one typically such footballing rivalries exist between bordering nations england is regarded in argentina as one of the major rivals of the national football team matched only by brazil and uruguay the rivalry is to a lesser extent reciprocal in england locally described as a grudge match although matches against germany carry a greater significance in popular perception the rivalry emerged across several games during the latter half of the th century even though as of the teams have played each other on only occasions in full internationals the rivalry was intensified particularly in argentina by nonfootballing events especially the falklands war between argentina and the united kingdom england

poorly in the group stage placing third with one win and two losses even though it qualified to the next round as the best thirdplaced team and beat defending champions mexico in the quarterfinals the team was eventually eliminated by panama who colombia had already lost to in the group stage prior to the tournament expectations were high for colombia with the team considered as tournament favourites which also marked a false reality after not making the final for the fifa world cup qualifiers reinaldo rueda would continue as manager colombia was ultimately unsuccessful in their campaign missing out by a single point due to uruguays win over argentina for the final fixture had uruguay and argentina drawn colombia would have qualified to the playoff spot with their away win

where the team experienced a similar situation to their previous qualification campaign and failed to qualify by a point despite winning their final match against paraguay thus colombia had failed to qualify for the world cup for the third time a row these failures to qualify for the world cup were mainly a result of constantly changing formations and a dysfunctional rotation of managers which saw pinto replaced by eduardo lara after a loss to chile in september combined with the struggle to score goals in the last games of the qualification the pkerman era revival and a new golden generation in june colombia were ranked th its lowest ever despite this ranking in the copa amrica colombia made a good run topping their group and achieving a draw to the host nation argentina in the next round

colombian team manager shortly after nstor lorenzo era present the colombian football federation announced on june that it had picked nstor lorenzo to replace rueda as coach of the mens national team for the next four years on february the federation launched an innovative project called futbol con futuro football with a future with the support of fifa the plan covers the period and aims to innovate as well as reinforce the modus operandi of all the countrys national teams so they can achieve success to achieve results on the pitch and enable colombia to win trophies said colombian football association fcf development director ivan novella setting out the ambitious objectives of futbol con futuro up until the copa america final loss in extra time to argentina on july colombia had gone games undefeated under lorenzo which included wins over germany brazil and spain rivalries venezuela colombias main geopolitical rival has always been venezuela however the rivalry is historically very onesided for colombia this state of affairs started to change from the late s when football slowly began replacing baseball as venezuelas main sport in coach luis garcia was sacked for only managing a draw in an away game in san cristbal which ended when a victory had been taken for granted this was just a sign of things to come four years later in the world cup qualifiers venezuela stunned the continent by defeating colombia in barranquilla the game showed the new direction of the rivalry while colombia remains ahead on all rankings and competitions venezuela always outperform themselves when meeting each other former captain valderrama started calling the games a classic and stated venezuela kill themselves do their best playing against us colombia would win in venezuela during world cup qualifying which marked their first win in venezuela since during jose pekermans coaching for the fifa world cup qualification considered the rebirth of colombian football venezuela still managed to win their game at home which was one of only three defeats the argentinean suffered venezuela also won the group stage game against colombia in the copa america which were their only three points although colombia still managed to advance to the knockout stage while venezuela ended last however the matches are still not as popular as the rival matches against argentina argentina the historical colombian victory in beating host argentina in the world cup qualifiers was the first time argentina lost in its home stadium estadio monumental during a qualifying match for a world cup argentina had come to the qualifiers as a world cup champion and finalist in the most recent editions and it caused a huge upset and start of a respective rivalry unlike other rivalries full of hostility the colombianargentine rivalry is more based on respect than a hated relationship always attracting great interest between both nations in the group stages of copa america another notable match occurred when colombia won with argentinas star striker martin palermo missing three penalty kicks after the wane of valderramas generation the rivalry became onesided again until recent years when the majority of the games started resulting in draws colombia and argentina faced each other in ten matches during the past years with colombia winning once and argentina twice and matches ending in draws tensions flourished again in after the semifinal match of the copa america a match which ended in a defeat for colombia after the penalty shootout when emiliano martnez the argentinean goalkeeper utilized provocative gestures and phrases to distract the colombian players which were broadcast on live television the episode sparked widespread controversy and reject from the colombian side while it was praised from the argentinian one adding up to the already heated relationship of the teams most recently in the two nations met in the final of the copa america which resulted in a extratime win for argentina brazil colombia had a more hostile rivalry against brazil due to the fifa world cup encounter where brazil defeated colombia overshadowed by neymars injury and referees favoritism towards brazil against colombia this would later cause matches between the two national teams to be more intense aggressive and to a certain extent played with great hostility with numerous violent incidents especially during the copa amrica where neymar was sent off during a brawl after the final whistle after the brazilian side suffered defeat as well during the quarterfinal match of the football tournament of the summer olympics between the two teams the rivalry would soon improve in a less hostile manner after the copa sudamericana finals when atltico nacional asked conmebol to award the trophy for associao chapecoense de futebol due to the lamia flight crash nonetheless it remains a competitive rivalry between the two which often sparks heated episodes among players of both teams ecuador although the headtohead record showcases a onesided advantage for colombia the increase of the footballing level in the neighboring nation of ecuador during recent years has ended in close matches between the two teams after colombia was unable to obtain more than one point from six possible during the qualifiers when the side often obtained four or six points from the encounters including a historic defeat against ecuador in media began calling the match the new classic of the region citing its potential for continuing to bring close matches with no clear favorites added to a new competitive atmosphere between both teams home stadium colombia plays their qualifying matches and friendlies at the estadio metropolitano roberto melndez in barranquilla which is the home stadium of the local football team atltico junior the stadium is named after former colombia national team player roberto melndez who is widely considered to be colombias best player during the colombias amateur era in the ss curiously the stadium was used for all of colombias successful qualification campaigns for the world cups in italy united states france additionally the venue was used for the

furthermore the team won three gold medals and three silver medals at the senior asian games the team is commonly nicknamed the reds by both fans and the media due to the color of their primary kit the national teams supporting group is officially referred to as the red devils history early history korea joseon was not introduced to the sport of association football until the late th century it is often said that football in korea dates to when the royal navy sailors from hms flying fish played a game while their vessel was visiting the incheon port korea became a japanese colony in and was annexed into it outright in in the first all joseon football tournament was held and in the joseon football association was organized which created a foundation to disseminate and develop football in korea korean teams participated in competitions with japanese teams from around joseon football club became a de facto national team for koreans and won the emperors cup koreans also played for the japan national team most notably kim yongsik who played for japan at the summer olympics the joseon fa was reorganized in as japanese occupation ended with the end of world war ii following the establishment of the south korean state in the late s a new korea football association kfa was founded in and joined fifa the international football governing body the same year the south korean

first fullyindependent asian nation to do so south korea lost their only two games by heavy margins against hungary the jointheaviest defeat in world cup history and against turkey their third

at the world cup finals again two years later south korea won the inaugural afc asian cup in they hosted the next edition in and successfully retained the title beating south vietnam israel and republic of china in the process however the south korean players received fake medals instead of the gold medals they had been promised and returned them to the kfa the kfa promised to give them real medals but this did not occur until south korea have not won the afc asian cup since something that has thus been attributed to the curse of the fake gold medals foundation of yangzee in the south korean government was hesitant to play football matches against north korea and thus withdrew from fifa world cup qualification to avoid possibly playing the northern neighbors kim yongsik the kfa vicepresident at that time had evaluated north korea as a worldclass team this would be proven true as the north koreans advanced to the quarterfinals at the finals in england in march the south korean central intelligence agency kcia founded yangzee fc collecting footballers in south korea to train them intensively yangzee players received benefits like exemption from military service longterm overseas training and high salaries in return for intensive training at the summer olympics qualification south korea was eliminated by goal difference despite being tied with japan the group winners on points they also participated in the asian champion club tournament finishing as runnersup however south korea failed to qualify for the fifa world cup despite governmental support and yangzee was losing support as kim hyonguk the director of kcia and supporter of the club was dismissed from his post and tensions between south and north korea were beginning to subside yangzee was eventually dissolved in march without ever having played against north korea but players achieved a good result by winning the asian games second world cup team in south korea won the east asian

they conceded alessandro altobellis opening goal but choi soonho scored the equalizer outside the penalty area however altobellis second goal was followed by cho kwangraes fatal own goal and south korea lost in the match despite huh jungmoo pulling one back afterwards south korean newscasts and journalists criticised the referee david socha claiming that his judgements about situations of the game were poor including the decision to award a penalty to italy south korea redeemed their failure of world cup success with a gold at the asian games tragedy of marseille in cha bumkun became the head coach going into fifa world cup qualification south korea consecutively won four early qualifiers against kazakhstan uzbekistan japan and the united arab emirates and quickly solidified their position as first place of the group at the fifa world cup in france they lost their first match against mexico ha seokju scored a deflected free kick for the opening goal but was then sent off only three minutes after for an illadvised tackle south korea was then thoroughly outclassed by the netherlands managed by guus hiddink losing in marseille cha was sacked in the middle of the group stage

to rejected entries and withdrawals teams eventually participated in the qualifying stages including eight for the first time mexico as the host nation and england as reigning world cup champions were granted automatic qualification with the remaining finals places divided among the continental confederations eight places were available to teams from uefa europe three for conmebol south america one for caf africa one for a team from either the afc or the ofc asiaoceania and one for concacaf north and central america and caribbean a place in the finals for an african team was guaranteed for the first time this was a response to the events of where all entered african nations boycotted the qualifying after fifa combined qualifying for africa asia and oceania into one group with only one place on offer and subsequently rejected caf requests to change the qualifying format or the allocation of places citing competitive and logistical issues thus while morocco was the first african team to make an appearance in the world cup since egypt in they were the first to be assured qualification at their own continental zone egypt had to play against the britainoccupied palestine to book their place at the tournament the draw for the qualifying stages was conducted on february in casablanca morocco with matches beginning in may and the final fixtures being concluded in december north korea quarterfinalists at the previous tournament were disqualified during the process after refusing to play in israel for political reasons el salvador qualified for the finals after beating honduras in a playoff match which was the catalyst for a fourday conflict in july known as the football war half of the eventual qualifying teams had also been present at the previous world cup but three teams qualified for the first time el salvador israel and morocco while peru romania belgium and sweden made their first world cup appearances since and respectively czechoslovakia returned to the world cup stage after missing out in as of this was the only time israel qualified for a fifa world cup finals and also the only time argentina failed to qualify they declined to participate in and chile spain and switzerland all did not qualify for the first time since while hungary did not qualify for the first time since france also failed to qualify as did portugal after finishing in third place at the tournament list of qualified teams the following teams qualified for the final tournament venues five stadiums in five cities were selected to host the world cup matches alternative venues in hidalgo state and the port city of veracruz were also considered each group was based solely in one city with exception of group which was staged in both puebla and toluca aside from the estadio luis dosal all the stadia had only been constructed during the s as mexico prepared to host both the world cup and the summer olympics the stadium construction cost for the four smaller venues were around us million while the final stadium in mexico city cost us million the altitude of the venues varied and the importance of acclimatisation was strongly considered by all the participating teams as a result in contrast to the previous tournament staged in england most teams arrived in the region well in advance of their opening fixtures to prepare for this factor some teams had already experienced the local conditions when competing in the football competition at summer olympics at an elevation in excess of metres ft above sea level toluca was the highest of the venues guadalajara was the lowest at m ft in addition to the altitude all five locations had hot and rainy weather where temperatures would regularly go past c f of the five stadia used for the matches played the largest and most utilised venue was the azteca stadium in mexico city which hosted total matches including the final and third place matches and all of group s matches which included all of host mexicos matches the jalisco stadium in guadalajara hosted eight matches including all of group s matches and a semifinal the nou camp stadium in leon hosted seven matches which consisted of all of group s matches and a quarterfinal match the luis dosal stadium in toluca hosted four matches and cuauhtmoc stadium in puebla hosted three matches and was the only stadium of the five used for this tournament not to host any knockout rounds format the qualified teams were divided into four groups of four each group was played as a single roundrobin in which each team would play each of the others in their group once teams were ranked by the number of points earned from their matches two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw and goal difference was used as the primary tiebreaker if two teams finished level on both points and goal difference lots were drawn to separate them this method was used to separate the top two teams in group soviet union and mexico but it was not used to separate bulgaria and morocco in group despite them finishing level on points and goal difference as their final positions did not have any implications for the knockout stage the top two teams from each group progressed to the knockout stage in all knockout matches extra time was played if the teams were drawn after minutes if teams were still tied after extratime drawing of lots would have been used in all matches other than the final fifa did not announce in advance what would happen if the final itself were to be drawn after extra time in the event all knockout matches were decided in either regular time or extra time final draw although it was reported in the buildup to the final draw that seedings would be used as had been the case at the previous two world cup finals the fifa organising committee ultimately announced on the same day of the draw that there would be no seeding of teams due to failed attempts to reach a compromise for the seeding criteria instead the qualified teams were divided into four pots comprising geographical groupings decided by a vote of the fifa organising committee which for the composition of pot and also took into account the teams strengths and even political considerations the tournament structure ensured that teams grouped within the same pot would not meet each other before the quarterfinals at the earliest the system of politically decided pots hereby ensured that israel and morocco would not be drawn to face each other after morocco had earlier threatened to withdraw from the tournament as they had done from the olympic football tournament two years earlier if that were the case the draw was staged in mexico city mexico on january in the maria isabel hotel which served as fifas headquarters during the competition the teams were drawn into the four groups which had their locations defined in advance group being staged in mexico city group in puebla and toluca group in guadalajara and group in len ahead of the draw the fifa regulations had predetermined that the hosts mexico would be in group and so based in the capital city and that england as holders would be based together with group in guadalajara the tournaments second largest stadium keeping the defending champion holders apart from meeting the hosts in the group stage either by seeding or predetermined group positions was a practiced tradition throughout the history of the fifa world cup with and being the only two exceptions the yearold daughter of guillermo caedo president of the mexican football federation and chief of the fifa organising committee drew out the teams from four silver cups so that each of the four groups featured one drawn team respectively from pot pot pot and pot match officials squads a tournament squad was limited to no more than players morocco named only players in their squad tournament review group stage following the opening ceremony host nation mexico faced the soviet union this was the last time until the world cup that the host nations first match rather than the world cup holders began the tournament both this opening match of group and many others during the competition kicked off at noon for the benefit of european television schedules meaning play under the midday sun the match produced a goalless draw prompting some media to predict the entire tournament would be played at the slow tempo that featured in this game given the conditions involved following the halftime interval anatoliy puzach became the first substitute to be used in fifa world cup history as the soviets made use of the new competition rule both teams won their remaining two games to progress from the group at the expense of belgium and world cup debutants el salvador group was the lowestscoring of the groups with only six goals in its six matches as uruguay reigning south america champions and italy the reigning european champions edged past sweden and israel sweden would have progressed if they had produced a twogoal victory against uruguay in their final game but it was not until the final minute that they scored the only goal of the game hours before the game fifa elected to replace the scheduled referee after bribery rumours later dismissed by fifa arose in mexico the result meant uruguay advanced to be joined by italy after they avoided defeat in the group finale against israel owing to the lack of a seeding system group allowed the reigning world cup holders england to be paired together with the twotime former champion brazil considered by many the pretournament favourites for the trophy englands preparations were hampered by the arrest of their captain bobby moore in colombia for allegedly stealing a bracelet from a jewellers shop the charges were later dropped the attitude of their manager alf ramsey and the english media in general was perceived by many locals as unfriendly and xenophobic toward mexicos hosting of the competition which meant the english team received a largely hostile response during the competition with both having won their opening games against czechoslovakia and romania respectively brazil met england in the groups most famed match although gordon banks in the english goal denied pel from close range with a reflex save that pel himself cited as the greatest of his career a second half goal from jairzinho won the match for brazil after which england squandered several excellent opportunities to equalise both teams then won their final group games to progress to the knockout stage play in group began with bulgaria taking a twogoal lead against peru but a second half comeback gave the south americans a victory morocco the first african world cup representatives since also began strongly by taking the lead against the runnersup west germany but the germans came back to win west germany also went behind against bulgaria in their second match but a gerd mller hattrick helped them recover and win the eventual golden boot winner mller hit another hattrick the only hattricks of the entire tournament to win the group against peru knockout stage quarterfinals mexico and the soviet union had finished tied at the top of group on both points and goal difference meaning that the drawing of lots was required to rank them on june the draw allocated the soviet union the group winners berth meaning that they would face uruguay at the estadio azteca while the host nation were paired against italy in the smaller toluca venue mexican officials unsuccessfully appealed to fifa to stage their game in the capital to avoid traffic problems the hosts took the lead against italy with a jos luis gonzlez goal but his teammate javier guzmn equalised with an own goal before halftime italy then dominated the second half to progress to the semifinals with a win the soviet union were also eliminated in their quarterfinal when a vctor esprrago header three minutes from the end of extratime sent uruguay through the soviets had stopped play during uruguays attack leading to the goal believing that the ball had crossed the touchline the allsouth america tie in guadalajara was the highestscoring of the four quarterfinals as brazil recorded a triumph over peru the match is considered to be one of the most entertaining matches in world cup history brazil shot times peru next came a rematch of the previous world cup final between england and west germany that took place in len the reigning champions took a twogoal lead but franz beckenbauer halved the deficit when his low shot beat englands secondchoice goalkeeper peter bonetti who was playing after gordon banks suffered food poisoning the day before eight minutes from time an uwe seeler header levelled the score englands geoff hurst then had an apparently legitimate goal ruled out for offside an extratime goal from gerd mller brought west germanys firstever competitive victory over england semifinals all four of the semifinalists were former world champions with the lineup guaranteeing a final between europe and south america in the allsouth american tie controversially switched from the capital to the lower altitude of guadalajara brazil came from behind to defeat uruguay and earn the right to contest their fourth world cup final two brazilian goals in the final minutes decided a match that had been evenlymatched until that point the alleuropean meeting between italy and west germany produced a match regarded by many as one of the greatest world cup games of all time having led from the eighth minute through roberto boninsegnas strike italy were pegged back in injury time when sweeper karlheinz schnellinger scored his only international goal extratime brought five more goals as the lead swung between the two sides until gianni rivera gave the azzurri a decisive lead the match subsequently became known as the game of the century and today has a plaque outside the estadio azteca to commemorate it west germany went on to defeat uruguay in the thirdplace match final in the final brazil opened the scoring when pel headed in a cross from rivellino in the th minute but roberto boninsegna equalised for italy after a series of blunders in the brazilian defence the match remained level until the th minute when a powerful shot from grson restored the brazilians lead further goals from jairzinho and carlos alberto rewarded brazils attacking play and secured a victory and a record third world cup triumph which earned them the right to permanently keep the jules rimet trophy legacy both the brazilian team that were crowned champions of the world cup and the tournament itself have become regarded as among the very finest in the history of the fifa world cup in contrast to the more physical style of play that had dominated the previous two tournaments the finals are noted for the attacking play adopted by most teams for the first time at a world cup finals referees could issue yellow and red cards a system that is now commonplace at every level of football worldwide yet in contrast to the previous tournaments besides the edition and all subsequent tournaments to date no player was expelled from play the officiating of the opening match commentated by some media as overly strict set a standard of discipline that instead helped protect skillful players in accordance with fifas stated wish the eventual champions brazil led by carlos alberto and featuring pel clodoaldo grson jairzinho rivellino and tosto is often cited as the greatestever world cup team they won all of their six games on the way to the title and had also won every one of their qualifying fixtures jairzinhos feat of scoring in every finals match likewise has yet to be equalled coach mrio zagallo became the first man to win the world cup as both a player and coach this was the first world cup to use the telstar ball from adidas who have supplied every world cup match ball to date introduced as the telstar erlast for the european football championship the telstar was the first world cup ball to use the nowfamiliar truncated icosahedron for its design consisting of black pentagonal and white hexagonal panels the panel configuration had been introduced in by select sport and was also used in the official logo for the world cup the blackandwhite pattern to aid visibility on black and white television broadcasts which was still commonplace then as colour television was rare in many parts of the world was also well established before the telstar the name came from the telstar communications satellite which was roughly spherical and dotted with solar panels somewhat similar in appearance to the football merchandise forming a

world cup they felt winning their zone was enough in itself to merit qualification the confederation of african football caf felt that the lack of direct representation of african nations in the world cup was unfair and demanded that fifa guarantee at least one african nation a spot in the finals of the following tournament they also protested against the readmission of south africa to fifa in despite their expulsion from caf due to the countrys apartheid regime in as a result of this boycott fifa fined caf swiss francs yidnekatchew tessema then president of the caf responded to this punishment by saying fifa has adopted a relentless attitude against the african associations and its decisions resemble methods of intimidation and repression designed to discourage any further impulses of a similar nature in our opinion the african national associations really deserved a gesture of respect rather than a fine south africa was subsequently assigned to the asia and oceania qualifying group before being disqualified after being suspended again due to pressure from other african nations in october despite this fifa refused to change the qualifying format citing competitive and logistical issues and the african teams withdrew in protest caf subsequently informed fifa that they would refuse to participate in world cup qualifying for unless at least one african

mozambique participated for portugal north koreaunited kingdom relations the united kingdom which had fought for south korea in the korean war was concerned over the entry of north korea in the tournament the uk did not recognise north korea and feared that its presence would strain relations with south korea and the united states fifa told englands football association that the tournament would be moved if any qualified team were to be refused entry on the suggestion of the british foreign office the playing of national anthems and meetings between players and state figures such as queen elizabeth ii would only take place in two games the opener and the final north korea was not scheduled for the former and was considered unlikely to reach the latter a foreign office suggestion for flags outside stadiums to be removed after each teams elimination in the expectation of an early north korean exit was vetoed by the department of education and science trophy incident the world cup had a rather unusual hero off the field a dog called pickles in the buildup to the tournament the jules rimet trophy was stolen from an exhibition display a nationwide hunt for the icon ensued it was later discovered wrapped in newspaper as the dog sniffed under some bushes in london the fa commissioned a replica cup in case the original cup was not found in time this replica as well as

cup final with doping format the format of the competition remained the same as qualified teams were divided into four groups of four each group played a roundrobin format two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw with goal average and eventually drawing lots used to separate teams equal on points the top two teams in each group advanced to the knockout stage in the knockout games if the teams were tied after minutes minutes of extra time were played for any match other than the final if the teams were still tied after extra time lots would be drawn to determine the winner the final would have been replayed if tied after extra time but if still tied after the replay the champion would have been decided by drawing lots in the event no replays or drawing of lots were necessary the draw for the final tournament taking place on january at the royal garden hotel in london was the first ever to be televised with england west germany brazil and italy as seeds venues eight venues were used for this world cup the newest and biggest venue used was wembley stadium in north west london which was years old in as was often the case in the world cup group matches were played in two venues close to each other group matches which included the hosts were all played in london five at wembley which was englands national stadium and was considered to be the most important football venue in the world and one at white city stadium in west london which was used as a temporary replacement for nearby wembley the group stage match between uruguay and france played at white city stadium originally built for the summer olympics was scheduled for a friday the same day as regularly scheduled greyhound racing at wembley because wembleys owner refused to cancel this the game had to be moved to the alternative venue in london group s matches were played at hillsborough stadium in sheffield and villa park in birmingham group s matches were played at old trafford in manchester and goodison park in liverpool and group s matches were played at ayresome park in middlesbrough and roker park in sunderland the stadium construction cost are estimated to be todays equivalent of million additional to million for tournament organisation the most used venue was wembley which was used for nine matches including all six featuring england the final and the thirdplace match goodison park was used for five matches roker park and hillsborough both hosted four while old trafford villa park and ayresome park each hosted three matches and did not host any knockout round matches tournament summary the opening match took place on monday july which made it the second world cup after to not begin on may or june before the tournament began eventual winners england were second favourites with bookmakers behind brazil while beaten finalists west germany were outsiders the final took place on saturday july the th anniversary of the first final until this was the latest date that any tournament had concluded the reason for the unusually late scheduling of the tournament appears to lie with the outside broadcast commitments of the bbc which also had commitments to cover wimbledon which ran between june and july and the open golf championship to july group stage was a world cup with few goals as the teams began to play much more tactically and defensively this was exemplified by alf ramseys england as they finished top of group with only four goals but having none scored against them they also became the first world cup winning team not to win its first game in the tournament uruguay were the other team to qualify from that group at the expense of both mexico and france all the groups matches were played at wembley stadium apart from the match between uruguay and france which took place at white city stadium in group west germany and argentina qualified with ease as they both finished the group with points spain managed while switzerland left the competition after losing all three group matches fifa cautioned argentina for its violent style in the group games particularly in the scoreless draw with west germany which saw argentinean rafael albrecht get sent off and suspended for the next match in the northwest of england old trafford and goodison park played host to group which saw the twotime defending champions brazil finish in third place behind portugal and hungary and be eliminated along with bulgaria brazil were defeated by hungary in a classic encounter before falling by the same scoreline to portugal in a controversial game portugal appeared in the finals for the first time and made quite an impact they won all three of their games in the group stage with a lot of help from their outstanding striker eusbio whose nine goals made him the tournaments top scorer group however provided the biggest upset when north korea beat italy at ayresome park middlesbrough and finished above them thus earning qualification to the next round along with the soviet union this was the first time that a nation from outside europe or the americas had progressed from the first stage of a world cup the next would be morocco in knockout stages the quarterfinals provided a controversial victory for west germany as they cruised past uruguay the south americans claimed that this occurred only after the referee who was jim finney from england had not recognised a handball by schnellinger on the goal line and then had sent off two players from uruguay horacio troche and hctor silva it appeared as though the surprise package north korea would claim another major upset in their match against portugal at goodison park when after minutes they led it fell to one of the greatest stars of the tournament eusbio to change that he scored four goals in the game and jos augusto added a fifth in the th minute to earn portugal a win meanwhile in the other two games ferenc benes late goal for hungary against the soviet union who were led by lev yashins stellar goalkeeping proved little more than a consolation as they crashed out and the only goal between argentina and england came courtesy of englands geoff hurst during that controversial game for more details see argentina and england football rivalry argentinas antonio rattn became the first player to be sent off in a senior international football match at wembley rattn at first refused to leave the field and eventually had to be escorted by several policemen scoreless when rattin was dismissed the game was decided by hursts headed goal twelve minutes from the end of normal time this game is called el robo del siglo the robbery of the century in argentina all semifinalists were from europe bobby charlton scored both goals in englands win with portugals goal coming from a penalty in the nd minute after a handball by jack charlton on the goal line the other semifinal also finished franz beckenbauer scoring the winning goal with a left foot shot from the edge of the area for west germany as they beat the soviet union portugal went on to beat the soviet union to take third place portugals third place was the best finish by a team making its world cup debut since it was equalled by croatia in final londons wembley stadium was the venue for the final and people attended after minutes seconds helmut haller put west germany ahead but the score was levelled by geoff hurst four minutes later martin peters put england in the lead in the th minute england looked set to claim the title when the referee awarded a free kick to west germany with one minute left the ball was launched goalward and wolfgang weber scored with england appealing in vain for handball as the ball came through the crowded penalty area with the score level at at the end of minutes the game went to extra time in the th minute hurst found himself on the scoresheet again his shot hit the crossbar bounced down onto the goal line and was awarded as a goal debate has long raged over whether the ball crossed the line with the goal becoming part of world cup history englands final goal was scored by hurst again as a celebratory pitch invasion began this made geoff hurst the first player to have scored three times in a single world cup final bbc commentator kenneth wolstenholmes description of the matchs closing moments has gone down in history some people are on the pitch they think its all over hurst scores it is now englands total of eleven goals scored in six games set a new record low for average goals per game scored by a world cup winning team the record stood until when it was surpassed by italys goals in seven games in this record was lowered again by spain winning the cup with eight goals in seven games englands total of three goals conceded also constituted a record low for average goals per game conceded by a world cup winning team that record stood until when it was surpassed by brazils three goals in seven games france again lowered the record to two goals in seven during the tournament a record that has since been equalled by italy at the tournament and by spains two goals conceded during the tournament england received the recovered jules rimet trophy from queen elizabeth ii and were crowned world cup winners for the first time in this world cup the national anthems were played only in the final they were not played in the earlier matches because the organisers fifa and the fa feared that north koreas presence a socialist country that was not recognised by the united kingdom in the world cup would cause problems

permitted exceptions by comparison the womens football tournament is a full seniorlevel international tournament second in prestige only to the fifa womens world cup another major difference between

games and the final was an allsouth american affair because no other major international tournament existed yet uruguay defeated argentina in what david goldblatt says was footballs first world championship after these tournaments fifa realized that the olympic movement prevented nations from competing on an equal footing and given that the olympics only permitted amateurs to participate did not represent the true strength of the international game the popularity of international soccer gave fifa the incentive to create an international tournament and fifa began organising the world cup

around the world the gap in quality between the world cup and the olympics widened the countries that benefited most were the soviet bloc countries of eastern europe where top athletes were statesponsored while retaining their status as amateurs as a result young western amateurs had to face seasoned and veteran soviet bloc teams which put them at a significant disadvantage all olympic football tournaments from to were dominated by the soviet union and its satellites between and out of olympic medals were won by eastern europe with only sweden gold in and bronze in denmark bronze in and silver in and japan bronze in breaking their dominance the next two tournaments saw some changes due to fifas changing of the callup rules with only yugoslavia bronze in and the soviet union gold in winning medals for the eastern bloc changes and developments for the los angeles games the ioc decided to admit professional players however fifa still did not want the olympics to rival the world cup a compromise was struck that allowed teams from countries outside of uefa and conmebol to field their strongest sides while restricting uefa and conmebol the strongest confederations whose teams had played all finals and won every single world cup title countries to players who had not played in a world cup the rules were maintained also for the edition but with an additional rider any european and south american footballers who had previously played less than minutes in one single match of the world cup were eligible present age restrictions introduced since male competitors have been required to be under years old and since a maximum of three overyearold players have been allowed per squad african countries have taken particular advantage of this with nigeria and cameroon winning in and respectively because of the unusual format and the separation from the main national teams that play the world cup and top continental tournaments historically strong mens national teams have unimpressive olympic records uruguay who won the two tournaments prior to the world cups creation only qualified again in after an year absence argentina won silver twice and before the tournament but its appearance in athens in which it won the first gold medal was only their seventh overall brazils silver medals in the and editions were the best they had achieved until backtoback golds in and the former on home soil italy has only won the olympic title once in although along with the two bronzes the team has the highest number of appearances in the tournament with the last in france won the olympic title in but only qualified twice ever since a team from germany won the gold medal only once in east germany and the reunified team did not make an olympic appearance until when they won silver spain has won gold in and the former as hosts and followed it with two silver medals in and having also won a third in along with a few failures to qualify british noninvolvement football in the united kingdom has no single governing body and there are separate teams for the uks four home nations england northern ireland scotland and wales further to this only the english football association fa is affiliated to the british olympic association boa and the fa entered great britain teams to the football tournaments until in the fa abolished the distinction between amateur and professional football and ceased to enter the olympics even though fifa has allowed professionals at the olympics since the fa did not reenter as the home nations were concerned that a united british olympic team would set a precedent that might cause fifa to question their separate status in other fifa competitions and even their status on or the existence of the international football association board when london was selected to host the games there was pressure on the english fa to exercise the host nations automatic right to field a team in the plan agreed by the fa with the welsh fa scottish fa and irish fa was only to field english players however the boa overruled this and ultimately there were welsh players in the mens squad and scots players in the womens squad after the games the fa decided that no team would be entered in subsequent mens tournaments but was open to fielding a womens team again the distinction recognised the importance and status of olympic football in the womens international game for the tournament fifa stated that the womens uk team not applied to the mens uk team may enter the olympics after the four fas agreed depending on the performance of womens english team in fifa womens world cup which serves as the european qualification for the olympics this brought womens football under the boa jurisdiction in line with the longstanding qualification rules in field hockey and rugby sevens although the home nations sevens teams were subsumed into a standing great britain team in venues due to the number of large stadia required for the olympic tournament venues in distant cities often more than km mi away from the main host are typically used for the football tournament in an extreme example two earlyround venues for the games were on the east coast of the united states well over miles km from the host city of los angeles the next games held in the united states the games were unique in that no matches were held in the host city of atlanta the nearest venue and the site of the finals was miles km away on the university of georgia campus in athens counting the and summer olympics there are venues that have hosted olympic football the most of any sport events competition format from the summer olympics football games always start before the opening ceremony because of the events calendar which needs to be longer than other sports since football starts two days before the games opening ceremonies and since then it is a common condition for some sports for both the mens and womens tournaments the competition consists of a roundrobin group stage followed by a knockout stage teams are placed into groups of teams with each team playing each other team in its group once teams earn points for a win point for a draw and points for a loss the top two teams in each group as well as the top two thirdplace finishers in the womens tournament advance to the knockout rounds the knockout rounds are a singleelimination tournament consisting of quarterfinals semifinals and the gold and bronze medal matches matches consist of two halves of minutes each since during the knockout rounds if the match is tied after minutes two minute halves of extra time are played extra time is skipped in favour of immediate penalty kicks in the bronze medal match if it is played on the same day in the same stadium as the gold medal match if the score remains tied penalty kicks which is rounds plus extra rounds if tied are used to determine the winner the qualifying tournament like that for the world cup is organised along continental lines most continental confederations organise a special under qualifying tournament although the european qualifiers are drawn from the finalists of the uefa under

copa del generalsimo now the copa del rey the first match at les corts was won by barcelona real madrid comfortably won the second leg beating barcelona according to football writer sid lowe there have been relatively few mentions of the game since and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in madrid indeed the occupies a far more prominent place in barcelonas history this was the game that first formed the identification of madrid as the team of the dictatorship and barcelona as its victims it has been alleged by local journalist paco aguilar that barcelonas players were threatened by police in the changing room though nothing was ever proven despite the difficult political situation cf barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the s and s in with josep samitier as coach and players like csar ramallets and velasco they won la liga for the first time since they added two more titles in and in they also won the first copa latina in june barcelona signed lszl kubala who was to be an important figure at the club on a rainy sunday of the crowd left les corts stadium after a win against santander by foot refusing to catch any trams and surprising the francoist authorities the reason was simple at the same time a tram strike was taking place in barcelona receiving the support of blaugrana fans events like this made cf barcelona represent much more than just catalonia and many progressive spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms coach ferdinand dauk and lszl kubala led the team to five different trophies including la liga the copa del generalsimo the copa latina the copa eva duarte and the copa martini rossi in in the club won la liga and the copa del generalsimo again club de ftbol barcelona with helenio herrera

liga and fairs cup double in in they became the first club to beat real madrid in a european cup playoff however they lost to benfica in the final the s were less successful for the club with real madrid monopolising la liga the completion of camp nou finished in meant the club had little money to spend on new players the s saw the emergence of josep maria fust and carles rexach and the club won the copa del generalsimo in and the fairs cup in barcelona restored some pride by beating real madrid in the copa del generalsimo final at the santiago bernabu in front of dictator francisco franco with coach salvador artigas a former republican pilot in the civil war with the end of francos dictatorship in the club changed its official name back to futbol club barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design including the original letters once again the season saw the arrival of johan cruyff who was bought for a world record from ajax already an established player with ajax cruyff quickly won over the barcelona fans when he told the european press that he chose barcelona over real madrid because he could not play for a club associated with francisco franco he further endeared himself when he named his son jordi after the local catalan saint george next to champions like juan manuel asensi carles rexach and hugo sotil he helped the club win the season for the first time since defeating real madrid at the santiago bernabu en route he was crowned european footballer of the year in during his first season with barcelona his second ballon dor win he won his first while playing for ajax in cruyff received this prestigious award a third time the first player to do so in while he was still with barcelona nez and stabilization in josep llus nez became the first elected president of fc barcelona and since then the members of barcelona have elected the club president the process of electing a president of fc barcelona was closely tied to spains transition to democracy in and the end of francos dictatorship the new presidents main objective was to develop barcelona into a worldclass club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch his presidency was to last for years and it deeply affected the image of barcelona as nez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline letting go of such players as diego maradona romrio and ronaldo rather than meeting their demands on may the club won its first european cup winners cup by beating fortuna dsseldorf in basel in a final watched by more than travelling blaugrana fans the same year nez began to invest in the clubs youth programme by converting la masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad the name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of barcelona in june diego maradona was signed for a world record fee of million from boca juniors in the following season under coach csar luis menotti barcelona won the copa del rey beating real madrid maradonas time with barcelona however was shortlived and he soon left for napoli at the start of the season terry venables was hired as manager and he won la liga with noteworthy displays by german midfielder bernd schuster the next season he took the team to their second european cup final only to lose on penalties to steaua bucureti during a dramatic evening in seville around this time tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president nezs dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group boixos nois the group identified with a leftwing separatism repeatedly demanded the resignation of nez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches at the same time barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads who often identified with a rightwing separatism the skinheads slowly transferred the boixos nois ideology from liberalism to fascism which caused division within the group and a sudden support for nezs presidency inspired by british hooligans the remaining boixos nois became violent causing havoc leading to largescale arrests after the fifa world cup barcelona signed the english top scorer gary lineker along with goalkeeper andoni zubizarreta but the team could not achieve success as schuster was excluded from the team terry venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the season and replaced with luis aragons the season finished with the players rebelling against president nez in an event known as the hesperia mutiny and a victory in the copa del rey final against real sociedad in johan cruyff returned to the club this time as manager and he assembled what would later be dubbed the dream team he used a mix of spanish players like pep guardiola jos mari bakero jon andoni goikoetxea miguel angel nadal and txiki begiristain while signing international players such as ronald koeman michael laudrup romrio and hristo stoichkov it was ten years after the inception of the youth programme la masia when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team pep guardiola the future coach of barcelona was one of the first graduates and would go on to receive international recognition under cruyffs guidance barcelona won four consecutive la liga titles from to they beat sampdoria in both the uefa cup winners cup final and the european cup final at wembley with a free kick goal from dutch international ronald koeman they also won a copa del rey in the european super cup in and three supercopa de espaa trophies with trophies cruyff became the clubs most successful manager at that point he also became the clubs longest consecutive serving manager serving eight years cruyffs fortune was to change and in his final two seasons he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president josep llus nez resulting in his departure reacting to cruyffs departure an independent protest group was organised by armand caraben joan laporta and alfons godall the objective of the group called lelefant blau was to oppose the presidency of nez which they regarded as a corruption of the clubs traditional values laporta would later take over the presidency of barcelona in cruyff was briefly replaced by bobby robson who took charge of the club for a single season in he recruited ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club psv and delivered a cup treble winning the copa del rey uefa cup winners cup and the supercopa de espaa with ronaldo registering goals in games despite his success robson was only ever seen as a shortterm solution while the club waited for louis van gaal to become available like maradona ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for inter milan in another world record transfer however new heroes emerged such as lus figo patrick kluivert luis enrique and rivaldo and the team won a copa del rey and la liga double in in the club celebrated its centenari winning the primera divisin title and rivaldo became the fourth barcelona player to be awarded european footballer of the year despite this domestic success the failure to emulate real madrid in the champions league led to van gaal and nez resigning in exit nez enter laporta the departures of nez and van gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of lus figo then club vicecaptain figo had become a cult hero and was considered by catalans to be one of their own barcelona fans however were distraught by figos decision to join archrivals real madrid and during subsequent visits to camp nou figo was given an extremely hostile reception upon his first return a piglets head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd the next three years saw the club in decline and managers came and went van gaal was replaced by lorenzo serra ferrer who despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of presided over a mediocre league campaign and a firstround champions league exit and was dismissed late in the season longserving barcelona deputy coach carles rexach was appointed as his replacement initially on a temporary basis and managed to at least steer the club to the last champions league spot on the final day of the season against valencia via an exceptional performance from rivaldo who completed arguably the greatest hattrick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification despite better form in la liga and a good run to the semifinals of the champions league rexach was never viewed as a longterm solution and that summer van gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager what followed despite another decent champions league performance was one of the worst la liga campaigns in the clubs history with the team as low as th in february this led to van gaals resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by radomir anti though a sixthplace finish was the best that he could manage at the end of the season antis shortterm contract was not renewed and club president joan gaspart resigned his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the clubs overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior after the disappointment of the gaspart era the combination of a new young president joan laporta and a young new manager former dutch and ac milan star frank rijkaard saw the club bounce back on the field an influx of international players including ronaldinho deco henrik larsson ludovic giuly samuel etoo rafael mrquez and edgar davids combined with home grown spanish players such as carles puyol andrs iniesta xavi and vctor valds led to the clubs return to success barcelona won la liga and the supercopa de espaa in and ronaldinho and etoo were voted first and third respectively in the fifa world player of the year awards in the season barcelona repeated their league and supercopa successes the pinnacle of the league season arrived at the santiago bernabu in a win over real madrid it was rijkaards second victory at the bernabu making him the first barcelona manager to win there twice ronaldinhos performance was so impressive that after his second goal which was barcelonas third some real madrid fans gave him a standing ovation in the champions league barcelona beat english club arsenal in the final trailing to a tenman arsenal and with less than minutes remaining they came back to win with substitute henrik larsson in his final appearance for the club setting up goals for samuel etoo and fellow substitute juliano belletti for the clubs first european cup victory in years despite being the favourites and starting strongly barcelona finished the season without trophies a preseason us tour was later blamed for a string of

including pope john paul ii who was an honorary member and former prime minister of spain jos luis rodrguez zapatero club rivalries el clsico there is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league and this is particularly the case in la liga where the game between barcelona and real madrid is known as the classic el clsico from the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in spain catalonia and castile as well as of the two cities the rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between catalans and the castilians seen by one author as a reenactment of the spanish civil war over the years the headtohead record between the two clubs is victories for madrid victories for barcelona and draws as early as the s barcelona had developed a reputation as a symbol of catalan identity opposed to the centralising tendencies of madrid in when francisco franco started the coup dtat against the democratic second spanish republic the president of barcelona josep sunyol member of the republican left of catalonia and deputy to the cortes was arrested and executed without trial by francos troops sunyol was exercising his political activities visiting republican troops north of madrid during the dictatorships of miguel primo de rivera and especially francisco franco all regional languages and identities in spain were frowned upon and restrained as such most citizens of barcelona were in strong opposition to the fascistlike regime in this period barcelona gained their motto ms que un club english more than a club because of its alleged connection to catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs theres an ongoing controversy as to what extent francos rule influenced the activities and onpitch results of both barcelona and real madrid fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives most historians agree than franco did not have a preferred football team but his spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams such as atltico aviacin and madrid fc that recovered its royal name after the fall of the republic on the other hand he also wanted the renamed cf barcelona succeed as spanish team rather than a catalan one during the early years of francos rule real madrid werent particularly successful winning two copa del generalsimo titles and a copa eva duarte barcelona claimed three league titles one copa del generalsimo and one copa eva duarte during that period atltico aviacin were believed to be the preferred team over real madrid the most contested stories of the period include real madrids home win against barcelona in the copa del generalsimo where the catalan team alleged intimidation and the controversial transfer of alfredo di stfano to real madrid despite his agreement with barcelona the latter transfer was part of real madrid chairman santiago bernabus revolution that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance bernabu himself a veteran of the civil war who fought for francos forces saw real madrid on top not only of spanish but also european football helping create the european cup the first true competition for europes best club sides his vision was fulfilled when real madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the first five editions of the european cup in the s these events had a profound impact on spanish football and influenced francos attitude according to historians during this time he realized the importance of real madrid for his regimes international image and the club became his preferred team until his death fernando maria castiella who served as minister of foreign affairs under franco from until noted that real madrid is the best embassy we have ever had franco died in and the spanish transition to democracy soon followed under his rule real madrid had won league titles copa del generalsimo titles copa eva duarte european cups latin cups and intercontinental cup in the same period barcelona had won league titles copa del generalsimo titles copa eva duarte titles intercities fairs cups and latin cups the rivalry was intensified during the s when the clubs disputed the signing of alfredo di stfano di stfano had impressed both barcelona and real madrid while playing for los millionarios in bogot colombia during a players strike in his native argentina soon after millonarios return to colombia barcelona directors visited buenos aires and agreed with river plate the last fifaaffiliated team to have held di stfanos rights for his transfer in for the equivalent of million italian lira according to other sources dollars this started a battle between the two spanish rivals for his rights fifa appointed armando muoz calero former president of the spanish football federation as mediator calero decided to let di stfano play the and seasons in madrid and the and seasons in barcelona the agreement was approved by the football association and their respective clubs although the catalans agreed the decision created various discontent among the blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in september barcelona sold madrid their halfshare and di stfano moved to los blancos signing a fouryear contract real paid million spanish pesetas for the transfer plus a million bonus for the purchase an annual fee to be paid to the millonarios and a salary for di stfano with a bonus double that of his teammates for a total of of the annual revenue of the madrid club di stfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by real madrid scoring twice in his first game against barcelona with him madrid won the first five editions of the european cup the s saw the rivalry reach the european stage when real madrid and barcelona met twice in the european cup with madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in and barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in in the european encounter between the clubs was dubbed the match of the century by spanish media and madrids win was watched by more than million people an intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams often involving mocking the opposition such notable celebrations occurred in when barcelona captain carles puyol kissed his catalan armband in front of incensed madrid fans at the santiago bernabu stadium and in when lionel messi celebrated his rdminute winner for barcelona against real madrid at the bernabu by taking off his barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed real madrid fans with his name and number facing them el derbi barcelon baras local rival has always been espanyol blanciblaus being one of the clubs granted royal patronage was founded exclusively by spanish football fans unlike the multinational nature of baras primary board the founding message of the club was clearly antibarcelona and they disapprovingly saw fc barcelona as a team of foreigners the rivalry was strengthened by what catalonians saw as a provocative representative of madrid their original ground was in the affluent district of sarri traditionally espanyol was seen by the vast majority of barcelonas citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority in stark contrast to baras revolutionary spirit also in the s and s while fc barcelona acted as an integrating force for catalonias new arrivals from poorer regions of spain expecting to find a better life espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen military officers civil servants and career fascists in espanyol started a counterpetition against autonomy which at that time had become a pertinent issue later on an espanyol supporter group would join the falangists in the spanish civil war siding with the fascists despite these differences in ideology the derbi has always been more relevant to espanyol supporters than barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives in recent years the rivalry has become less political as espanyol translated its official name and anthem from spanish to catalan though it is the most played local derby in the history of la liga it is also the most unbalanced with barcelona overwhelmingly dominant in the primera divisin league table espanyol has only managed to end above bara on three occasions from seasons and the only allcatalan copa del rey final was won by bara in espanyol has the

been completely white sometimes adorned with various types of decorations the most common of which are one vertical or horizontal red and black stripe the white away kit is considered by both the fans

s the clubs owners announced a modernisation of stamford bridge with plans for a stateoftheart allseater stadium work began in but the project was beset with problems and ultimately only the east stand was completed the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy the freehold was sold to property developers and the club were under threat of eviction from the stadium following a long legal battle it was not until the mids that chelseas future at stamford bridge was secured and renovation work resumed the north west and southern parts of the ground were converted into allseater stands and moved

significantly larger stadia such as arsenal and manchester united owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines fans can only enter stamford bridge via the fulham road which places

supporters club osc and the centenary supporters association csa city fans song of choice is a rendition of blue moon which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem city supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team and label unexpected results typical city events that fans regard as typical city include the club being the only reigning english champions ever to be relegated in the only team to score and concede over goals in the same season or the more recent example where manchester city were the only team to beat chelsea in the latters recordbreaking premier league season yet in the same season city were knocked out of the fa cup by oldham athletic a team two divisions lower in the late s city fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects to matches primarily oversized bananas one disputed explanation for the phenomenon is that in a match against west bromwich albion chants from fans calling for the introduction of imre varadi as a substitute mutated into imre banana terraces packed with inflatablewaving supporters became a frequent sight in the season as the craze spread to other clubs inflatable fish were seen at grimsby town with the craze reaching its peak at citys match at stoke city on december a game declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party in manchester city supporters adopted an exuberant dance dubbed the pozna from fans of polish club lech pozna that they played in the europa league in manchester city proposed the release of the connected scarf that would contain a sensor tracking physiological and emotional data of the wearer for supporters in rivalries manchester citys biggest rivalry is with neighbours manchester united against whom they contest the manchester derby before the second world war when travel to away games was rare many mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves supporters of only one this practice continued into the early s but as travel became easier and the cost of entry to matches rose watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified a common stereotype is that city fans come from manchester proper while united fans come from elsewhere a report by a researcher at manchester metropolitan university found that while it was true that a higher proportion of city season ticket holders came from manchester postcode areas compared to uniteds there were more united season ticket holders the lower percentage being due to uniteds higher overall number of season ticket holders compared to citys the report noted that since the compiling of data in the number of both city and united season ticket holders had risen expansion of uniteds ground and citys move to the city of manchester stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further over the last few years manchester city has also developed a notable rivalry with liverpool currently considered one of the biggest in association football though the two clubs had been involved in a title race in the season liverpool and citys modern rivalry began in the s with the blues beating liverpool to the title by just two points on the final day of the season in the final of the league cup city defeated liverpool on penalties after a draw the two clubs met in european competition for the first time in the champions league quarterfinals where liverpool won on aggregate ultimately reaching the final and then winning the competition a year later in the season city again won the title on the final day with the blues points and liverpools being the third and fourthhighest premier league points totals ever the following season liverpool clinched the title recording points the secondhighest premier league total ever after manchester citys in to finish points above runnersup city the blues then regained the title in and outgunned liverpool in another closelyfought title race in to finish with points to liverpools the success of the two teams in the s and s has led to the development of a rivalry between jrgen klopp and pep guardiola the managers of liverpool and manchester city with the two previously having been the respective managers of der klassiker rivals borussia dortmund and bayern munich in the bundesliga at the end of the season guardiola described his relationship with klopp as a beautiful rivalry and called klopps liverpool team the strongest opponents i have faced in my career as a manager in september klopp hailed guardiola for being his greatest rival ever after both were nominated for the fifa mens coach of the year award in which klopp ultimately won in a survey city fans answered that liverpool and not manchester united are the

brewery and located behind a public house named the white hart on tottenham high road the road white hart lane actually lies a few hundred yards north of the main entrance the ground was initially

and associations the castle is bruce castle yards from the ground and the trees are the seven sisters the arms featured the latin motto audere est facere to dare is to do in to overcome unauthorised pirate merchandising the clubs badge was altered by adding the two red heraldic lions to flank the shield which came from the arms of the northumberland family of which harry hotspur was a member as

club have included such figures as philosopher a j ayer there are many official supporters clubs located around the world while an independent supporters club the tottenham hotspur supporters trust is officially recognised by the club as the representative body for spurs supporters historically the club had a significant jewish following from the jewish communities in east and north london with around a third of its supporters estimated to be jewish in the s due to this early support all three chairmen of the club since have been jewish businessmen with prior history of supporting the club the club no longer has a greater jewish contingent among its fans than other major london clubs jewish supporters are estimated to form at most of its fanbase though it is nevertheless still identified as a jewish club by rival fans antisemitic chants directed at the club and its supporters by rival fans have been heard since the s with words such as yids or yiddos used against tottenham supporters in response to the abusive chants tottenham supporters jewish and nonjewish alike began to chant back the insults and adopt the yids or yid army identity starting from around the late s or early s some fans view adopting yid as a badge of pride helping defuse its power as an insult the use of yid as a selfidentification however has been controversial some argued that the word is offensive and its use by spurs fans legitimises references to jews in football and that such racist abuse should be stamped out in football both the world jewish congress and the board of deputies of british jews have denounced the use of the word by fans others such as former prime minister david cameron argued that its use by the spurs fans is not motivated by hate as it is not used pejoratively and therefore can not be considered hate speech attempts to prosecute tottenham fans who chanted the words have failed as the crown prosecution service considered that the words as used by tottenham fans could not be judged legally threatening abusive or insulting fan culture there are a number of songs associated with the club and frequently sung by spurs fans such as glory glory tottenham hotspur the song originated in after spurs completed the double in and the club entered the european cup for the first time their first opponents were grnik zabrze the polish champions and after a hardfought match spurs suffered a reverse tottenhams tough tackling prompted the polish press to write that they were no angels these comments incensed a group of three fans and for the return match at white hart lane they dressed as angels wearing white sheets fashioned into togas sandals false beards and carrying placards bearing biblicaltype slogans the angels were allowed on the perimeter of the pitch and their fervour whipped up the home fans who responded with a rendition of glory glory hallelujah which is still sung on terraces at white hart lane and other football grounds the lilywhites also responded to the atmosphere to win the tie then manager of spurs bill nicholson wrote in his autobiography a new sound was heard in english football in the season it was the hymn glory glory hallelujah being sung by fans at white hart lane in our european cup matches i dont know how it started or who started it but it took over the ground like a religious feeling there had been a number of incidents of hooliganism involving spurs fans particularly in the s and s significant events include the rioting by spurs fans in rotterdam at the uefa cup final against feyenoord and again during the uefa cup matches against feyenoord in rotterdam and anderlecht in brussels although fan violence has since abated the occasional incidence of hooliganism continues to be reported rivalries tottenham supporters have rivalries with several clubs mainly within the london area the fiercest of these is with north london rivals arsenal the rivalry began in when arsenal moved from the manor ground plumstead to arsenal stadium highbury and this rivalry intensified in when arsenal were unexpectedly promoted to the first division taking a place that tottenham believed should have been theirs tottenham also share notable rivalries with fellow london clubs chelsea and west ham united the rivalry with chelsea is secondary in importance to the one with arsenal and began when tottenham beat chelsea in the fa cup final the first ever alllondon final west ham fans view tottenham as a bitter rival although the animosity is not reciprocated to the same extent by tottenham fans social responsibility the club through its community programme has since been working with haringey council and the metropolitan housing trust and the local community on developing sports facilities and social programmes which have also been financially supported by barclays spaces for sport and the football foundation the tottenham hotspur foundation received highlevel political support from the prime minister when it was launched at downing street in february in march the club announced a partnership with the charity sos childrens villages uk whereby player fines would go towards this charitys childrens village in rustenburg south africa to support of a variety of community development projects in and around rustenburg in the financial year tottenham topped a league of premier league charitable donations when viewed both in overall terms and as a percentage of turnover by giving including a oneoff contribution of million over four years to set up the tottenham hotspur foundation in contrast they have successfully sought the reduction of section planning obligations connected to the redevelopment of the stadium in the northumberland development project initially the development would incorporate affordable housing but this requirement was later waived and a payment of m for community infrastructure was reduced to m this is controversial in an area which has suffered high levels of deprivation as spurs had bought up properties for redevelopment removing existing jobs and businesses for property development but not creating enough new jobs for the area the club however argued that the project when completed would support jobs and inject an estimated million into the local economy annually and that it would serve as the catalyst for a wider year

following after initial successes the side immediately won the football league centenary trophy and followed it with the football league title snatched with a lastminute goal in the final game of the season against fellow title challengers liverpool grahams arsenal won another title in losing only one match won the fa cup and league cup double in and the european cup winners cup in grahams

their previous campaign crest unveiled in royal arsenals first crest featured three cannons viewed from above pointing northwards similar to the coat of arms of the metropolitan borough of woolwich nowadays transferred to the coat of arms of the royal borough of greenwich these can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys but the presence of a carved lions head and a cascabel on each are clear indicators that they are cannons this was dropped after the move to highbury in only to be reinstated in when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon pointing eastwards with the clubs nickname the gunners inscribed alongside it this crest only lasted until when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down in the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the clubs name set in blackletter typography and above the coat of arms of the metropolitan borough of islington and a scroll inscribed with the clubs newly adopted latin motto victoria concordia crescit vcc victory comes from harmony coined by the clubs programme editor harry homer for the first time the crest was rendered in colour which varied slightly over the crests lifespan finally becoming red gold and green because of the numerous revisions of the crest arsenal were unable to copyright it although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark and had fought and eventually won a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold unofficial arsenal merchandise arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection therefore in they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style which was copyrightable the cannon once again faces east and the clubs name is written in a sansserif typeface above the cannon green was replaced by dark blue the new crest was criticised by some supporters the arsenal independent supporters association claimed that the club had ignored much of arsenals history and tradition with such a radical modern design and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue until the s a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for highprofile matches such as fa cup finals usually in the form of a monogram of the clubs initials in red on a white background the monogram theme was developed into an art decostyle badge on which the letters a and c framed a football rather than the letter f the whole set within a hexagonal border this early example of a corporate logo introduced as part of herbert chapmans rebranding of the club in the s was used not only on cup final shirts but as a design feature throughout highbury stadium including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors from a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts until replaced by the club crest sometimes with the addition of the nickname the gunners in the s in the season arsenal celebrated their th anniversary the celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season the crest was allwhite surrounded by oak leaves to the right and laurel leaves to the left the oak leaves represent the founding members of the club who met at the royal oak pub the laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club the laurel leaves also represent strength to complete the crest and are shown on either sides of the motto forward at the bottom of the crest starting in the season adidas reintroduced the cannononly crest on that seasons away kit it was the first time it had been seen on an arsenal shirt since it would remain in use on the away kit in and in would be added to the third kit as well before being used on all three kits in marking the first time the crest would not be seen on an arsenal kit since its introduction in colours for much of arsenals history their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts though this has not always been the case the choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from nottingham forest soon after arsenals foundation in two of dial squares founding members fred beardsley and morris bates were former forest players who had moved to woolwich for work as they put together the first team in the area no kit could be found so beardsley and bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball the shirt was redcurrant a dark shade of red and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops in herbert chapman wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed updated the kit adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves one story reports that chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist tom webster with whom chapman played golf regardless of which story is true the redandwhite shirts have come to define arsenal and the team have worn that combination ever since that time aside from two seasons the first was when arsenal wore allred shirts this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season the second was the last season that arsenal played at highbury when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in their first season in the stadium the side reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season in the season arsenal replaced the traditional allwhite sleeves with red sleeves that bore a broad white stripe arsenals home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs in sparta prague

santa fe and a fan of arsenal selected the main colours for his newly created team in sporting clube de bragas manager returned from a game at highbury and changed his teams green kit to a duplicate of arsenals redwithwhitesleevesandshorts giving rise to the teams nickname of os arsenalistas these teams still wear those designs to this day for many years arsenals away colours were white or navy blue however in the fa banned navy shirts they looked too similar to referees black kit so in the season arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts this kit was worn in the fa cup final when arsenal beat liverpool to secure the double for the first time in their history the yellow and blue strip became almost as famous as their iconic redandwhite home kit arsenal reached the fa cup final again the following year wearing the redandwhite home strip and were beaten by leeds united arsenal then competed in three consecutive fa cup finals between and wearing their lucky yellow and blue strip which remained the clubs away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in the following season arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme albeit with a darker shade of blue than before when nike took over from adidas as arsenals kit provider in arsenals away colours were again changed to twotone blue shirts and shorts since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market the away kits have been changed regularly with arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits during this period the designs have been either all blue designs or variations on the traditional yellow and blue such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the season the yellow and dark grey used from to and the yellow and maroon of to until the away kit was changed every season and the outgoing away kit became the thirdchoice kit if a new home kit was being introduced in the same year after puma began manufacturing arsenals kits in new home away and third kits were released every season in the season puma released a new colour scheme for the away and third kits the away kit was a light blue which faded to a darker blue near the bottom while the third kit was black with red highlight puma returned to the original colour scheme for the season from the season arsenals kits are manufactured by adidas kit suppliers and shirt sponsors stadiums

dribbling skills and close control at speed allowed him to change direction quickly making him difficult for opponents to defend against on his dribbling ability former dutch player johan cruyff saw similarities between maradona and lionel messi with the ball seemingly attached to their boot his physical strengths were illustrated by his two goals against belgium in the world cup although he was known for his penchant for undertaking individual runs with the ball he was also a strategist and an intelligent team player with excellent spatial awareness as well as being highly technical with the ball he was effective in limited spaces and would attract defenders only to quickly dash out of the melee as in the second goal against england in or give an assist to a free teammate being short but strong he could hold the ball long enough with a defender on his back to wait for a teammate making a run or to find a gap for a quick shot he showed leadership qualities on the field and captained argentina in their world cup campaigns of and while he was primarily a creative playmaker maradona was also known for his finishing and goalscoring ability former milan manager arrigo sacchi also praised maradona for his defensive workrate off the ball in a interview with il corriere dello sport the team leader on and off the field he would speak up on a range of issues on behalf of the players maradonas ability as a player and his overpowering personality had a major positive effect on his team with his world cup teammate jorge valdano stating maradona was a technical leader a guy who resolved all difficulties that may come up on the pitch firstly he was in charge of making the miracles happen thats something that gives teammates a lot of confidence secondly the scope of his celebrity was such that he absorbed all the pressures on behalf of his teammates what i mean is one slept soundly the night before a game not just because you knew you were playing next to diego and diego did things no other player in the world could do but also because unconsciously we knew that if it was the case that we lost then maradona would shoulder more of the burden would be blamed more than the rest of us that was the kind of influence he exercised on the team lauding the charisma of maradona another of his argentina teammates prolific striker gabriel batistuta stated diego could command a stadium have everyone watch him i played with him and i can tell you how technically decisive he was for the team napolis former president corrado ferlaino commented on maradonas leadership qualities during his time with the club in describing him as a coach on the pitch one of maradonas trademark moves was dribbling fullspeed on the right wing and on reaching the opponents goal line delivering accurate passes to his teammates another trademark was the rabona a reversecross pass shot behind the leg that holds all the weight this manoeuvre led to several assists such as the cross for ramn dazs header against switzerland in moreover he was also a wellknown proponent of the roulette a feint which involved him dragging the ball back first with one foot and then the other while simultaneously performing a turn due to his penchant for using this move it has even occasionally been described as the maradona turn in the media he was also a dangerous free kick and penalty kick taker who was renowned for his ability to bend the ball from corners and direct set pieces regarded as one of the best deadball specialists of all time his free kick technique which often saw him raise his knee at a high angle when striking the ball thus enabling him to lift it high over the wall allowed him to score free kicks even from close range within to yards to metres from the goal or even just outside the penalty area his style of taking free kicks influenced several other specialists including gianfranco zola andrea pirlo and lionel messi maradona was famous for his cunning personality some critics view his controversial hand of god goal at the world cup as a clever manoeuvre with one of the opposition players glenn hoddle admitting that maradona had disguised it by flicking his head at the same time as palming the ball the goal itself has been viewed as an embodiment of the buenos aires shanty town maradona was brought up in and its concept of viveza criollacunning of the criollos although critical of the illegitimate first goal england striker gary lineker conceded when diego scored that second goal against us i felt like applauding it was impossible to score such a beautiful goal hes the greatest player of all time by a long way a genuine phenomenon maradona used his hand in the world cup again without punishment and this time on his own goal line to prevent the soviet union from scoring a number of publications have referred to maradona as the artful dodger the urchin pickpocket from charles dickens oliver twist maradona was dominantly leftfooted often using his left foot even when the ball was positioned more suitably for a rightfooted connection his first goal against belgium in the world cup semifinal is a worthy indicator of such he had run into the inside right channel to receive a pass but let the ball travel across to his left foot requiring more technical ability during his run past several england players in the previous round for the goal of the century he did not use his right foot once despite spending the whole movement on the righthand side of the pitch in the world cup secondround tie against brazil he used his right foot to set up the winning goal for claudio caniggia due to two brazilian markers forcing him into a position that made use of his left foot less practical reception pel scored more goals lionel messi has won more trophies both have lived more stable lives than the overweight former cocaine addict who tops this list whose relationship with football became increasingly strained the longer his career continued if youve seen diego maradona with a football at his feet youll understand maradona is widely regarded as the best player of his generation he is considered one of the greatest players of all time by pundits players and managers and by some as the best player ever known as one of the most skilful players in the game he is regarded as one of the greatest dribblers and free kick takers in history a precocious talent in his youth in addition to his playing ability maradona also drew praise from his former manager menotti for his dedication determination and the workethic he demonstrated in order to improve the technical aspect of his game in training despite his natural gifts with the manager noting im always cautious about using the word genius i find it hard to apply that even to mozart the beauty of diegos game has a hereditary element his natural ease with the ball but it also owes a lot to his ability to learn a lot of those brushstrokes those strokes of genius are in fact a product of his hard work diego worked very hard to be the best maradonas former napoli manager ottavio bianchi also praised his discipline in training commenting diego is different to the one that they depict when you got him on his own he was a very good kid it was beautiful to watch him and coach him they all speak of the fact that he did not train but it was not true because diego was the last person to leave the pitch it was necessary to send him away because otherwise he would stay for hours to invent free kicks however although as bianchi noted maradona was known for making great plays and doing unimaginable and incredible things with the ball during training sessions and would even go through periods of rigorous exercise he was equally known for his limited workrate in training without the ball and even gained a degree of infamy during his time in italy for missing training sessions with napoli while he often trained independently instead of with his team in a documentary film on his life diego maradona maradona confessed that his weekly regime consisted of playing a game on sunday going out until wednesday then hitting the gym on thursday regarding his inconsistent training regimen the films director asif kapadia commented in he had a metabolism he would look so incredibly out of shape but then hed train like crazy and sweat it off by the time matchday came along his body shape just didnt look like a footballer but then he had this ability and this balance he had a way of being and that idea of talking to him honestly about how a typical week transpired was pretty amazing he also revealed that maradona was ahead of his time in the fact that he had a personal fitness coach fernando signorini who trained him in a variety of areas in addition to looking after his physical conditioning adding while he maradona was in a football team he had his own regime how many players would do that how many players would even know to think like that im different to anyone else so i need to train at what im good at and what im weak at signorini is very well read and very intelligent he would literally say this is the way im going to train you read this book he would help him psychologically talk to him about philosophy and things like that moreover maradona was notorious for his poor diet and extreme lifestyle off the pitch including his use of illicit drugs and alcohol abuse which along with personal issues his metabolism medication that he was prescribed and periods of inactivity due to injuries and suspensions led to his significant weightgain and physical decline as his career progressed his lack of discipline and difficulties in his turbulent personal life are thought by some in the sport to have negatively impacted his performances and longevity in the later years of his playing career a controversial figure in the sport while he earned critical acclaim from players pundits and managers over his playing style he also drew criticism in the media for his temper and confrontational behaviour both on and off the pitch however in paolo maldini described maradona both as the greatest player he ever faced and also as the most honest stating he was a model of good behaviour on the pitch he was respectful of everyone from the great players down to the ordinary team member he was always getting kicked around and he never complained not like some of todays strikers franco baresi stated when he was asked who was his greatest opponent maradona when he was on form there was almost no way of stopping him while fellow former italy defender giuseppe bergomi described maradona as the greatest player of all time in zlatan ibrahimovi said that his offfield antics did not matter and that he should only be judged for the impact he made on the field for me maradona is more than football what he did as a footballer in my opinion he will be remembered forever when you see number who do you think about maradona it is a symbol even today there are those who choose that number for him today his skills would afford him greater protection back then they merely served as the red rag of provocation that would guarantee he would be the victim of brutal challenges wherever he played the rules changed as a direct result of some of the injuries maradona received when i interviewed him a few years ago he told me he thought players such as lionel messi owed him a great deal because some of the tackles he had endured would never be allowed today in maradona was placed second behind pel by world soccer in the magazines list of the greatest players of the th century along with pel maradona was one of the two joint winners of the fifa player of the century award in

sent into space with the international space station crew in march and came back to earth in early june style of play and legacy ronaldo is regarded as one of the greatest and most complete forwards of all time nicknamed il or o fenomeno the phenomenon he was a prolific goalscorer and despite being more of an individualistic attacker he was also capable of providing assists for his teammates due to his vision passing and crossing ability he was an extremely powerful fast and technical player with excellent movement as well as being a composed finisher highly regarded for his technical ability ronaldo was able to use both feet despite being naturally right footed and is considered one of the most skillful dribblers in the game ronaldo would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal with rob smyth writing he played like every attack had a second deadline he would explode into life with no warning for defenders he frequently beat several players when dribbling at speed and excelled in one on one situations due to his ball control acceleration agility balance and nimble footwork in his prime his coach at barcelona bobby robson commented ronaldo could start from the halfway line and the whole stadium would ignite he was the fastest thing ive ever seen running with the ball had he managed to stay free of injury he had every chance of becoming the best footballer ever in one on one situations ronaldo often used elaborate feints to trick and beat defenders and goalkeepers he popularised the use of many football tricks such as the elastico and the step over sid lowe of sports illustrated wrote when he was one on one with the goalkeeper you knew that he would score he was so natural so cool so utterly in control he would dip the shoulder step over and bang his barcelona teammate scar garca observed id never seen anyone play football with such technical ability creativity and precision at that incredible speed what stood out to all of us from the moment we met ronnie was that he could do things which other players found very difficult and make them look easy but he could also produce those things while running at an unbelievable explosive pace with his combination of speed skill and finishing ronaldinho called ronaldo the most complete striker there has ever been a view echoed by zlatan ibrahimovi who stated as a football player he was complete there will never in my view be a better player than him the goalscoring idol of lionel messi the argentine states ronaldo was the best striker ive ever seen he was so fast he could score from nothing wanting to emulate ronaldo growing up egypt and liverpool forward mohamed salah opined the ability the speed the intelligence he had everything naming ronaldo as an inspiration wayne rooney stated as an outandout forward he was probably the best the outstanding influence for a generation of strikers from karim benzema to sergio agero with romelu lukaku stating he changed the dimension of a striker and could dribble like a winger run like a sprinter zlatan added nobody influenced football and the players who emerged as much as ronaldo ronaldo as so many of those who looked up to him acknowledge changed what it is to be a centreforward every time you see a striker who is expected to hold the ball up beat players win headers shoot from range drop deep do everything a striker can possibly do it might be worth remembering him he shifted boundaries challenged convention just as much as messi and cristiano ronaldo have altered our perceptions of what a winger might be ronaldo the original ronaldo inspired a phalanx of imitators players we see on our screens every weekend but he also turned the game so that it will always look just a little bit like him more than most he made that no his own emilio butragueo stated ronaldo creates a goalscoring opportunity where it doesnt exist most strikers need the midfielders and their teammates but he does not on his speed of thought kak said for me the best players are those who are able to think of a play and execute it quickest and in the best way possible and ronaldo was the best at that the speed of thought he had and the speed he had to carry out his actions were perfect ronaldo was also a strong and powerful player who could shield the ball from the opposition with former italian defender alessandro nesta who faced ronaldo in a highprofile one on one duel in the uefa cup final which was billed as the best attacker against the best defender in serie a stating it was the worst experience of my career ronaldo is the hardest attacker ive ever had to face asked who was the toughest opponent of his career fabio cannavaro responded i have no doubt ronaldo the phenomenon for my generation he was what maradona or pel were for the previous ones he was unmarkable sid lowe compared ronaldos ability to take on a number of opponents on a single run to what rugby player jonah lomu was doing in the same era regarding ronaldos influence on the evolution of the centreforward role french former forward thierry henry said he did things nobody had seen before he together with romrio and george weah reinvented the centreforward position they were the first to drop from the box to pick up the ball in midfield switch to the flanks attract and disorientate the central defenders with their runs their accelerations their dribbling comparing his natural ability to roger federer paul macdonald of goal wrote theres a joy to be had watching something we know to be extremely difficult executed with considerable ease ronaldo in his prime was able to do that better than anyone who has ever played the game a reliance on his superior innate ability is given as a reason for his application in training often not being as high as his teammates though his knee issues may also have been a factor with his brazil teammate emerson stating ronaldo felt he didnt need to work as hard as us that he could do in two days what the rest of us would take ten days to do and usually he was right on his precocious talent a talent which saw him become the youngest fifa world player of the year at age and youngest ballon dor recipient aged rob smyth of the guardian wrote in ronaldo is easily the best of the past years possibly ever the other ronaldo and messi were brilliant teenagers but had nothing like the same impact at that age only pel diego maradona and george best can really compare asked to name the best player of his lifetime jos mourinho said ronaldo el fenomeno cristiano ronaldo and leo messi have had longer careers they have remained at the top every day for years however if we are talking strictly about talent and skill nobody surpasses ronaldo mikal silvestre states i played against lionel messi and i played with cristiano at manchester united but he ronaldo is something else in terms of speed cristiano maybe you can guess that he has three or four tricks he would use most of the time but ronaldo it was always something different he was inventing things on the spot so you cant guide him left or right because hes going to get out of these situations no matter what in ronaldo was named in the ballon dor dream team a greatest alltime xi published by france football magazine at his physical peak in the s ronaldo became severely affected by the knee injuries he suffered from late onward and the subsequent weight gain during his inactivity which limited his speed fitness and mobility according to his physiotherapist nilton petrone ronaldo was vulnerable to injury due to a medical condition combined with his explosive running ronaldo had a problem called trochlear dysplasia this makes the relationship between the kneecap and the femur a bit unstable there is no direct surgery for that so the kneecap keeps for a lack of a better word dancing on the femur ronaldos injuries werent because his body was weak but because of his explosive capacity he didnt just run fast in a straight line he also changed direction at incredible speed ronaldo moved from left to right very fastso it was obvious by the way that he played that injuries were always a possibility acknowledging he was never quite the same after his knee injury in with his pace and sheer brute force diminished in comparison to the phenomenon in the s fourfourtwo magazine ranked him

admitted intentionally fouling ben thatcher in an england match against wales to get himself booked beckham was due to receive a onematch suspension for his next caution and had picked up an injury

played his last game for real madrid although he continued to train with the team a few days later while speaking to the students at villanueva university center in madrid caldern said that beckham is going to hollywood to be half a film star adding our technical staff were right not to extend his contract which has been proved by the fact that no other technical staff in the world wanted him except los angeles about a month later however capello backtracked on his earlier statement allowing beckham to rejoin the team for the match against real sociedad on february the player immediately

responsible for the teams huge increase in merchandise sales a total reported to top us million during beckhams four years at the club la galaxy first season in mls beckhams involvement with major league soccer mls began while he was still a real madrid player when it was confirmed on january that he would be leaving madrid in six months to join mls side la galaxy the speculation about his new contract in madrid was thus put to an end and the following day beckhams official press conference was held in conjunction with the mls superdraft the announcement made global headlines and elevated the leagues profile though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth us million the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be a pr stunt engineered by beckhams media handlers british representative agency entertainment to maximise the media effect in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that beckham could make over the fiveyear period from all his revenue sources which in addition to his galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements beckhams actual deal with the galaxy was a fiveyear contract worth us million in total or million per year

off a new fiveyear shirt sponsorship deal with the herbalife nutrition company worth us million the gate revenue peaked as well with new season tickets holders and soldout luxury suites each one of the inside the teams home stadium the home depot center la galaxy owners anschutz entertainment group aeg also reported an immediate spike in business involved on many business fronts worldwide aeg

fixed price of million whenever he stopped playing in the league an allowance that the leagues owners had never given to a player before another provision was the optout clause after the season meaning that should he decide so beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his fiveyear contract the league had a salary cap in place requiring the creation of the designated player rule for beckham to bypass the cap the rule was later nicknamed in his honor in april he and wife victoria bought an million home on san ysidro drive in beverly hills beckhams contract with la galaxy took effect on july and on july he was officially unveiled as a galaxy player at the home depot center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than gathered fans and some accredited media members beckham chose to wear number it was announced that galaxy jersey sales had already reached a record figure of over prior to this formal introduction in parallel beckhams handlers at entertainment succeeded in putting together an unprecedented us media rollout designed to expand his carefully crafted personal brand in america he made the cover of sports illustrated a

since both beckhams and his wifes often overlapping careers were handled by entertainment which is owned by simon fuller who in turn has a business relationship with the creative artists agency caa one of hollywoods most powerful talent agencies it was important for caa that the beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the us on july caa had hosted a welcoming bash for

despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as andriy shevchenko didier drogba michael ballack and frank lampard the us television cameras were firmly focused on beckham who spent most of the match on the bench the matchs added time featured a scare for already injured beckham when he got tackled by steve sidwell whose cleats struck beckhams right foot sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground though the existing injury was not aggravated too much beckhams recovery process was set back by about a week espns presentation of beckhams debut earned a tv rating

fc though he still made the trip with his teammates sitting on the bench in street clothes it was in toronto on august that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with beckham on the roster due to security concerns it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match rather than flying commercial mls normally forbids charter flights for away matches

alongside pirlo though lacking match fitness and occasionally struggling to keep up in a hightempo match beckham put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify the coach carlo ancelottis decision to play him from the start in beckhams home debut against fiorentina a week later he turned in another understated performance on the right side of midfield before advancing into a more active central role in the second half thus effectively taking over seedorfs role after the dutchman was subbed off milan won courtesy of pato but the san siro crowd mostly focused on kak imploring him to stay a

opponents directly with the ball he formed a strong partnership on the right side of the pitch with fullback gary neville during his time with the club due to their understanding as well as nevilles

is from martinique he was born and raised in les ulis suburb of paris which despite sometimes being seen as a tough neighbourhood provided good footballing facilities as a sevenyearold henry showed great potential prompting claude chezelle to recruit him to the local club co les ulis his father pressured him to attend training although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football he joined us palaiseau in but after a year his father fell out with the club so henry moved to es virychtillon and played there for two years us palaiseau coach jeanmarie panza henrys future mentor followed him there club career beginnings at monaco and transfer to juventus in monaco sent scout arnold catalano to watch henry then at the age of in a match henry scored all six goals as his side won catalano asked him to join monaco without even attending a trial first catalano requested that henry complete a course at the elite inf clairefontaine academy and despite the directors reluctance to admit henry due to his poor school results he was allowed to complete the course and joined arsne wengers monaco as a youth player subsequently henry signed professional forms with monaco and made his professional debut on august in a loss against nice although wenger suspected that henry should be deployed as a striker he put henry on the left wing because he believed that his pace natural ball control and skill would be more effective against full backs than centrebacks after a tentative start to his monaco career henry was named the french young footballer of the year in and in the season his solid performances helped the club win the ligue title during the season he was instrumental in leading his club to the uefa champions league semifinal setting a french record that was broken since by scoring seven goals in the competition by his third season he had received his first cap for the national team and was part of the winning team in the fifa world cup he continued to impress at his tenure with monaco and in his five seasons with the club the young winger scored league goals in appearances henry left monaco in january one year before his intimate and closest teammate david trezeguet and moved to italian club juventus for million he played on the wing as well as at wing back and wide midfield but he was ineffective as a goal scorer struggling against the defensive discipline exhibited by teams in serie a registering just three goals in appearances in on jamie carraghers podcast the greatest game henry attributed disagreements with juve director luciano moggi as his rationale behind departing the club move to arsenal breakthrough and success unsettled in italy henry transferred from juventus on august to arsenal for an estimated fee of million reuniting with his former manager arsne wenger it was at arsenal that henry made his name as a worldclass footballer and although his transfer was not without controversy wenger was convinced he was worth the transfer fee brought in as a replacement for fellow french forward nicolas anelka henry was immediately moulded into a striker by wenger a move that would pay rich dividends in years to come however doubts were raised about his ability to adapt to the quick and physical english game when he failed to score in his first eight games after several difficult months in england henry even conceded that he had to be retaught everything about the art of striking these doubts were dispelled when he ended his first season at arsenal with an impressive goal tally of arsenal finished second in the premier league behind manchester united and lost in the uefa cup final against galatasaray coming off the back of a victorious uefa euro campaign with the national team henry was ready to make an impact in the season despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season henrys second season with arsenal proved to be a breakthrough as he became the clubs top goalscorer his goal tally included a spectacular strike against manchester united where he flicked the ball up with his back turned to goal before he swivelled and volleyed in from yards out the strike also featured a memorable goal celebration where he recreated the budweiser whassup advertisement armed with one of the leagues best attacks arsenal finished runnerup to perennial rivals manchester united in the premier league the team also reached the final of the fa cup losing to liverpool henry remained frustrated however by the fact that he had yet to help the club win honours and frequently expressed his desire to establish arsenal as a powerhouse success finally arrived during the season arsenal finished seven points above liverpool to win the premier league title and defeated chelsea in the fa cup final henry became the leagues top goalscorer and netted goals in all competitions as he led arsenal to a double and his first silverware with the club there was much expectation that henry would replicate his club form for france during the fifa world cup but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage proved to be another productive season for henry as he scored goals in all competitions while contributing assistsremarkable returns for a striker in doing so he led arsenal to another fa cup triumph where he was manofthematch in the final although arsenal failed to retain their premier league title throughout the season he competed with manchester uniteds ruud van nistelrooy for the league scoring title but the dutchman edged henry to the golden boot by a single goal nonetheless henry was named both the pfa players player of the year and fwa footballer of the year his rising status as one of the worlds best footballers was affirmed when he emerged runnerup for the fifa world player of the year award with goals and assists in the league henry set a new record for most assists in a single premier league season and also became the first player in history to record at least goals and assists in a single season in one of europes topfive leaguesthis feat has since been matched by lionel messi in entering the season arsenal were determined to reclaim the premier league crown henry was again instrumental in arsenals exceptionally successful campaign together with the likes of dennis bergkamp patrick vieira freddie ljungberg and robert pires henry ensured that the gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten claiming the league title in the process apart from being named for the second year running as the pfa players player of the year and fwa footballer of the year henry emerged once again as the runnerup for fifa world player of the year award with goals scored in all competitions the frenchman led the league in goals scored and won the european golden boot however as was the case in henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during uefa euro this dip in success was compounded when arsenal failed again to secure backtoback league titles when they lost out to chelsea in the season although arsenal did win the fa cup the final of which henry missed through injury henry maintained his reputation as one of europes most feared strikers as he led the league in scoring and with goals in all competitions he was the corecipient with diego forln of the european golden boot becoming the first player to officially win the award twice in a row ally mccoist had won two golden boots in a row but both were deemed unofficial the unexpected departure of arsenals captain patrick vieira in the close season led to henry being awarded club captaincy a role which many felt was not naturally suited for him the captaincy is more commonly given to defenders or midfielders who are betterplaced on the pitch to read the game along with being chief goalscorer he was responsible for leading a very young team which had yet to gel fully the season proved to be one of remarkable personal achievements for henry on october henry became the clubs top goalscorer of all time two goals against sparta prague in the champions league meant he broke ian wrights record of goals on february he scored a goal against west ham united bringing his league goal tally up to breaking arsenal legend cliff bastins league goals record henry scored his th league goal at highbury a feat unparalleled in the history of the club and a unique achievement in the premier league on the final day of the premier league season henry scored a hattrick against wigan athletic in the last match played at highbury he completed the season as the leagues top goalscorer was voted the fwa footballer of the year for the third time in his career and was selected in the fifa world xi nevertheless arsenal failed to win the premier league title again but hopes of a trophy were revived when arsenal reached the uefa champions league final the gunners eventually lost to barcelona with henry assisting the teams only goal from a free kick and arsenals inability to win the league title for two consecutive seasons combined with the relative inexperience of the arsenal squad caused much speculation that henry would leave for another club however he declared his love for the club and accepted a fouryear contract and said he would stay at arsenal for life arsenal vicechairman david dein later claimed the club had turned down two bids of million from spanish clubs for henry before the signing of the new contract had the transfer materialised it would have surpassed the thenworld record million paid for zinedine zidane henrys season was marred by injuries although he scored goals in domestic appearances for arsenal henrys season was cut short in february having missed games due to hamstring foot and back problems he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against psv in a champions league match but began limping shortly after coming on scans the next day

that henry was keen on staying with the gunners to rebuild for the season barcelona and a historic treble on june in an unexpected turn of events henry was transferred to barcelona for million he signed a fouryear deal for a reported million per season it was revealed that the contract included a release clause of million henry cited the departure of dein and continued uncertainty over wengers future as reasons for leaving and maintained that i always said that if i ever left arsenal it would be to play for barcelona despite their captains departure arsenal got off to an impressive start for the campaign and henry said that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help he stated because of my seniority the fact that i was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball they would sometimes give it to me even when i was not in the best position so in that sense it was good for the team that i moved on henry left arsenal as the clubs leading alltime league goalscorer with goals and leading alltime goalscorer in european competitions with goals in july arsenal fans voted him as arsenals greatest player ever in arsenalcoms gunners greatest players poll at barcelona henry was given the number jersey the same as he had worn at arsenal he scored his first goal for his new club on september in a champions league group stage win over lyon and he

goalscoring form he achieved with arsenal he expressed dissatisfaction with the move to barcelona in the initial year amidst widespread speculation of a return to the premier league in an interview with garth crooks on bbcs football focus henry described missing life back home and even the english press however henry concluded his debut season as the clubs top scorer with goals in addition to nine league assists second behind lionel messis ten henry went on to surpass this tally in a more integrated campaign with goals and assists from the left wing he won the first trophy of his barcelona career on may when barcelona defeated athletic bilbao in the copa del rey final barcelona won the primera divisin and uefa champions league soon after completing a treble for the frenchman who had combined with messi and samuel etoo to score goals between them that season the trio was also the most prolific trio in spanish league history scoring goals and surpassing the goals of real madrids

barcelona win an unprecedented sextuple consisting of the aforementioned treble the supercopa de espaa the uefa super cup and the fifa club world cup the following season the emergence of pedro meant

monaco and juventus playing on the wing when henry joined arsenal in wenger immediately changed this switching henry to his childhood position often pairing him with dutch veteran dennis bergkamp during the season wenger switched arsenals formation to this change forced henry to adapt again to fit into the arsenal team and he played many games as a lone striker still henry remained arsenals main offensive threat on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals wenger said of his fellow frenchman thierry henry could take the ball in the middle of the park and score a goal that no one else in the world could score one of the reasons cited for henrys impressive play up front is his ability to calmly score from oneonones according to his father antoine henry learned precision shooting from watching his idol marco van basten he was also influenced by romrio ronaldo and liberian star george weah a new breed of strikers in the s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal at his physical peak from the late s to the mid s henrys ability to dribble past opponents with exceptional pace skill and composure meant that he could get in behind defenders regularly enough to score in former arsenal striker alan smith commented on henry i have to say i havent seen a player like him hes an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best when up front henry is occasionally known to move out wide to the left wing position something which enables him to contribute heavily in assists between and the striker managed almost assists in total and this was attributed to his unselfish play and creativity ranking henry the greatest player in premier league history in february fourfourtwo magazine stated no one assisted more in a season no one has terrorised defenders with such a combination of bewitching grace and phenomenal power coming in from the left henrys trademark finish saw him place the ball inside the far right corner of the goal henry would also drift offside to fool the defence then run back onside before the ball is played and beat the offside trap although he never provided arsenal a distinct aerial threat given his versatility in being able to operate as both a winger and a striker the frenchman is not a prototypical outandout striker but he has emerged consistently as one of europes most prolific strikers in set pieces henry was the firstchoice penalty and free kick taker for arsenal scoring regularly from those situations henry was also a notable exponent of a nolook pass where he would feint to pass the ball with his right foot but would make contact with the ball using his standing foot his left managerial career arsenal youth henry began coaching arsenals youth

goalscorer of all time argentina eventually won the final against colombia setting messi with total appearances in the tournament while also marking argentinas second consecutive copa amrica win and third consecutive international tournament title with messi as captain player profile style of play due to his short stature messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players which gives him greater agility allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles this has led the spanish media to dub him la pulga atmica the atomic flea despite being physically unimposing he possesses significant upperbody strength which combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting his short strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed his former barcelona manager pep guardiola once stated messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mids messi is predominantly a leftfooted player with the outside of his left foot he usually begins dribbling runs while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists a prolific goalscorer messi is known for his finishing positioning quick reactions and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line he also functions in a playmaking role courtesy of his vision and range of passing he has often been described as a magician a conjurer creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist moreover he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker as of september messi ranks fifth all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with the most among active players he also has a penchant for scoring from chips messis pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal in particular during counterattacks usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch he is widely considered to be one of the greatest dribblers of all time with regard to this ability his former argentina manager diego maradona has said of him the ball stays glued to his foot ive seen great players in my career but ive never seen anyone with messis ball control beyond his individual qualities he is also a wellrounded hardworking team player known for his creative combinations in particular with former barcelona midfielders xavi and andrs iniesta as his career advanced and his athleticism and tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in football history his workrate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed by covering less ground on the pitch and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed he was able to improve his efficiency movement and positional play and was also able to avoid muscular injuries despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis indeed while he was injuryprone in his early career he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball and by adopting a stricter diet training regime and sleep schedule tactical positioning tactically messi plays in a free attacking role a versatile player he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch his favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers known as the enganche in argentine football but he began his career in spain as a leftwinger or leftsided forward upon his firstteam debut he was moved onto the right wing by manager frank rijkaard from this position he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates under guardiola and subsequent managers he most often played in a false nine role positioned as a centreforward or lone striker he would roam the centre often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him in order to create and exploit spaces for passes other teammates attacking runs off the ball messis own dribbling runs or combinations with xavi and iniesta under the stewardship of luis enrique messi initially returned to playing in the rightsided position that characterised much of his early career in the managers formation while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper free playmaking role in later seasons under manager ernesto valverde messi played in a variety of roles while he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role from which he could make runs from behind into the box or even on the right wing or as a false nine he was also used in a more offensive central role in a or as a second striker in a formation where he was once again given the licence to drop deep linkup with midfielders orchestrate his teams attacking plays and create chances for his attacking partner luis surez with the argentina national team messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline under various managers he has been employed on the right wing as a false nine as an outandout striker in a supporting role alongside another forward or in a deeper free creative role as a classic number playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers reception messi is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation alongside portuguese forward cristiano ronaldo and one of the greatest footballers of all time a prodigious talent as a teenager messi established himself among the worlds best players before age shortly after teammate ronaldinho won the ballon dor he commented im not even the best at bara in reference to his yearold protg four years later after messi won his first ballon dor by a record margin the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history an early proponent was his thenbarcelona manager pep guardiola who as early as august declared messi to be the best player he had ever seen in the following years this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits managers former and current players and by the end of baras second treblewinning season the view of messi as one of the greatest footballers of all time had become the apparent view among many fans and pundits in continental europe he initially received dismissals by critics based on the fact that he had not won an international tournament at senior level with argentina however messis subsequent victories in the copa amrica and the fifa world cup resulted in him finally winning every top tier trophy at both the club and country levels an achievement that many pundits felt cemented his legacy comparisons with cristiano ronaldo among his contemporary peers messi is most often compared and contrasted with cristiano ronaldo who many consider his career rival both achieved numerous individual accolades won dozens of trophies for both club and country and are the two leading goal scorers in history although messi has at times denied any rivalry they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world pundits have compared the ongoing rivalry to past sports rivalries like the muhammad alijoe frazier rivalry in boxing the prostsenna rivalry in motorsport and the tennis rivalries between federernadal and borgmcenroe fans and pundits alike regularly argue the individual merits of both players messi is lauded for his combination of dribbling playmaking passing and goalscoring while ronaldo has received praise for his exceptional speed and athleticism goalscoring skills and performance under pressure beyond their playing styles the debate also revolves around their differing physiques ronaldo is m ft in with a muscular build compared to messis smaller size and contrasting public personalities with ronaldos selfconfidence and theatrics a foil to messis humility regarding individual achievements messi has won eight ballons dor to ronaldos five eight fifa worlds best player awards to ronaldos five and six european golden shoes to ronaldos four off the pitch ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary sponsorships and social media fanbase messis headtohead record against teams that feature ronaldo consists of wins draws and losses in competitive club matches win and loss in international friendlies and win in a club

stage match where ronaldos two goals from the penalty spot helped juventus to a victory against messis barcelona after ronaldo left real madrid for juventus messi stated i miss cristiano although it was a bit difficult to see him win trophies he gave la liga prestige following messi leading argentina to victory in the world cup a number of football critics commentators and players have opined that messi settled the debate between the two players comparisons with diego maradona throughout his career messi has been compared with his compatriot diego maradona who was also considered the best player of his generation and one of greatest in the history of the sport this was due to their short statures their similar playing styles as diminutive leftfooted playmakers and the fact that they both came from argentina initially messi was merely one of many young argentine players to receive the new maradona moniker but as his career progressed messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders establishing himself as the best player argentina had produced since maradona even when messi was years old maradona called him the best player in the world and hailed him as his successor maradona and messi would work together as manager and player for argentinas national side from through the fifa world cup the former thoroughly impressed with the latters skills it was during this period that messi was given argentinas number shirt that maradona famously wore maradona gave messi his blessing telling him the no is yours theres nobody better than you to wear it during the early and middle parts of his career messi was generally held in lesser esteem than maradona in argentine society part of this had to do with messis lack of tournament success and perceived uneven output with the national team during this period maradona had famously led argentina to victory in the fifa world cup with a dominant overall performance which set expectations for messi to do the same also unlike maradona messi never played in the argentine primera divisin therefore depriving his countrymen a chance to watch him develop and prove himself and through no fault of his own would do this overseas in la liga instead argentines also identified more with the fiery and controversial maradona who came from the slums character traits that they felt aligned with their national values as opposed to the reserved and unassuming messi who had a comparable unremarkable upbringing in rosario several pundits footballing figures and maradona himself would point to this temperament to question messis leadership capabilities for the national team furthermore messis lack of outward passion for the albiceleste shirt early tendency not to sing the national anthem and disinclination to emotional displays have in the past led to the false perception that he felt more catalan rather than truly argentine however despite having lived in barcelona since age messi rejected the option of representing spain internationally saying argentina is my country my family my way of expressing myself i would change all my records to make the people in my country happy football journalist tim vickery stated the perception of messi among argentines changed in with messi making a conscious effort to become more one of the group more argentine other pundits noted that messi had grown more assertive as a leader during the copa amrica by becoming more vocal with his teammates both on and off the pitch finally singing the national anthem with the team before matches and speaking with journalists at length after matches the latter of which he rarely did for barcelona following the world cup win for messi and argentina vickery felt that messi would now be held in the same esteem by his compatriots as maradona former footballer turned journalist jorge valdano said he saw a maradonian edge to messis performances while compatriot osvaldo ardiles mentioned that messis provoking actions against the netherlands side during the quarterfinal were more of a maradona reaction further endearing messi to his countrymen messi himself later remarked that the world cup victory won over

wing as well as through the centre of the pitch and while ostensibly rightfooted is very strong with both feet tactically ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career while at sporting and during his first season at manchester united he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area in this position he was able to use his pace and acceleration agility and technical skills to take on opponents in oneonone situations ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair often displaying an array of tricks and feints such as the step overs and socalled chops that became his trademark he has also been known to use the flipflap his strength and jumping ability combined with his elevation heading accuracy and height of m ft in give him an edge in winning aerial duels these attributes allow him to function as a targetman and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area consequently many of his goals have been headers ronaldo holds the record for the highest recorded jump in football history measuring meters ft in which he achieved during a match against manchester united while playing for real madrid in the roundof of the uefa champions league in allied with his increased stamina and workrate his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks he has also increasingly played a creative role for his team often dropping deep to pick up the ball participate in the buildup of plays and create chances for his teammates courtesy of his vision and passing ability in his final seasons at united ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion he developed into a prolific goalscorer capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot courtesy of his striking ability an accurate penalty kick taker he also became a set piece specialist renowned for his powerful bending free kicks when taking free kicks ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique which was developed by juninho pernambucano he also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball which involves him standing with his legs far apart regarding ronaldos unique style of taking free kicks former united assistant manager mike phelan commented people used to put the ball down walk away run up and hit it he brought in a more dynamic showmanship he places the ball down the concentration level is high he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot he is the ultimate showman he has that slight arrogance when he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs he is saying all eyes on me and this is going in he understands the marketing side of it the way he struts up and places it the world is watching him at real madrid ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role while his creative and defensive duties became more limited although not entirely diminished initially deployed as a centre forward by managers manuel pellegrini and jos mourinho he was later moved back onto the left wing though in a free tactical role this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit madrids counterattacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player as evidenced by his recordbreaking goalscoring feats while he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role this unique role has been described by pundits as that of a false attacking or goalscoring winger as ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area despite actually playing on the left flank from onwards under manager carlo ancelotti he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced offtheball movement and general involvement completing fewer dribbles and passes per game and instead focusing on shortdistance creating and goalscoring since ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a freeroaming centre forward under manager zinedine zidane a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record in this position he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball positional sense linkup play and finishing as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities in his first season at juventus ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager massimiliano allegri depending on whom he was partnered with while he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at real madrid at times he functioned in a free role at juventus either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing in a or formation in which he often switched positions with mario manduki in this role he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball and be more involved in the buildup of plays as such aside from scoring goals himself he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with real madrid off the ball he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates crosses on occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside manduki in a or formation he continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager maurizio sarri reception and image ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation alongside argentina forward lionel messi winning his first ballon dor in by a recordhigh vote count at age over the next decade ronaldo has often featured in debates

a highly competitive team denmark experienced their next revival at the olympics with a third set of olympic silver medals this was followed by another notable performance at the european nations cup where denmark impressively finished in fourth place however this finish was considered by many as being more the result of a comparatively easy draw rather than a result of a wellplaying team in order for denmark to qualify for the semifinal they only had to defeat malta albania and luxembourg in the semifinal denmark fell to the soviet union then lost the thirdplace match to hungary the strict rule of only allowing amateurism at the national team was finally abolished by the dbu in may as they had acknowledged this change was needed in order to build a highly competitive team in february when the dbu also decided to allow professional football to be introduced in the danish leagues the way was at the same time paved for the national team to sign its first sponsorship with the wellknown danish brewery carlsberg the new sponsorship enabled the dbu to hire the german sepp piontek in july as the first fulltime professional coach of the national team the full transition of the national team from amateurism to professionalism had now been accomplished and indeed this would soon lead to a vast improvement in the performances of the team according to rob smyth and lars eriksen authors of a book on the danish dynamite team that would soon emerge that process the transition to professionalism was accelerated by the fact that so many of the national team were playing abroad and values learned there were slowly seeping in denmark got a headstart on football globalisation benefiting from the enlightenment and experience that comes with playing abroad at euro their man squad contained overseasbased players the other seven teams had only five between them at mexico their squad included players from the champions of italy west germany england holland and belgium but not denmark danish dynamite in the fifa world cup qualification denmark finished with four wins and four losses including a win against the eventual world cup champions italy but denmark failed to qualify for the final tournament qualification for uefa euro saw denmark defeat england at wembley stadium when allan simonsen converted a penalty kick for a win denmark qualified for their first international tournament since and the team was dubbed danish dynamite in a competition for the official danish euro song denmarks participation ended in the semifinal when the team lost on penalties to spain most remembered for preben elkjrs penalty miss his shorts torn apart following the strong performance at the finals the name danish dynamite became a mainstay for the following decade of the denmark national team under head coach sepp piontek denmark made their first world cup appearance in the world cup and with the attacking duo of michael laudrup and preben elkjr thrashed uruguay in the second round denmark once again faced spain and once more lost including four goals by emilio butragueo the first spanish goal was caused by a misstimed backpass by jesper olsen to butragueo an unfortunate action subsequently coined as a real jesper olsen en rigtig jesper olsen the phrase would live on for years and was repeated by the danish tv commentators in when an identical backpass was carried out by jesper grnkjr to filippo inzaghi in grnkjrs debut for the national team denmark qualified for euro and nearly made the olympics richard mller nielsen guided denmark to a secured spot for the final tournament ahead of west germany but following the discovery that dane per frimann was not eligible for the teams win over poland denmark was penalised and subsequently failed to qualify at euro denmarks participation ended in early defeat after denmark lost all the group games to spain west germany and italy they then failed to qualify for the world cup sepp piontek resigned as head coach of the national team in april where he was replaced by richard mller nielsen the mller nielsen fairytale european championship denmark began euro qualification with a home victory against the faroe islands and followed up with an away draw against northern ireland and a home loss against yugoslavia danes michael laudrup and brian laudrup opted to quit the national team in november when nielsen subsequently decided to dismiss quality players such as jan mlby and jan heintze from the squad due to disciplinary problems several newspapers began demanding that nielsen step down as head coach despite this denmark won the rest of their five matches in the qualification group including a away win against yugoslavia this was not enough to qualify as the team still had to settle for second place in the group behind yugoslavia due to international sanctions resulting from the yugoslav wars uefa announced on may only days before the competition that yugoslavia was to be excluded from the competition and their place given to denmark who finished as the secondplaced team in its qualifying group and ironically the best runnerup across all groups contrary to popular belief the team did not enter the tournament completely unprepared after having rallied home from seaside vacations the majority of players were already assembled to play a friendly match against the cis when denmark officially received yugoslavias spot relying heavily on goalkeeper peter schmeichel and his defense as well as creative spark brian laudrup having decided to make a comeback for the national team in april the danish team created one of the biggest surprises in the events history as they went on to win the european championship trophy under head coach nielsens defensive playing style advancing from the group stage ahead of england and france denmark defeated the netherlands the defending euro champions on penalties in the semifinal then in the final denmark won win against reigning world cup champions germany ensuring denmark its first international trophy decline and revival in august michael laudrup decided to settle his ongoing dispute with richard mller nielsen about the team tactics and made a comeback to the national team however the following years denmark saw mixed results as they first failed to qualify for the world cup but then won the confederations cup then known as king fahd cup beating copa amrica champions argentina in the final as defending champions at euro denmark disappointed with a lackluster performance after an early elimination in the group stage the team had achieved a respectable win against turkey a draw against portugal and only a defeat to croatia nielsens replacement was swede bo bosse johansson who gave the team a more offensive strategy and the world cup saw the revival of the danish team starring both laudrup brothers in their last international campaign after defeating saudi arabia drawing with south africa and losing to eventual champions france denmark defeated nigeria in the round of they exited in the quarterfinals with a loss to brazil without the laudrup brothers denmark qualified for euro only to lose all three matches in the group stage the olsen gang morten olsen was named the new manager for denmark in and the team was quickly dubbed the olsen gang a reference to the series of danish movies based around the main character egon olsen and his genius criminal plans the nickname was also used for the danish team as an alternative to the more commonly used danish dynamite already in those days when olsen played as a captain denmarks tactics shifted from the preferred formation practised by bo johansson to an even more attacking style with an emphasis on the wingers available at the time namely jesper grnkjr and dennis rommedahl accordingly olsens preferred formation was either a or a olsen even possessed an outspoken opposition to the system as he threatened to leave his position as head coach in the event he was asked to deploy denmark in that formation to support the development of players for the new tactical system all national youth teams also changed their formation another change olsen brought to the national team was to stress the importance of only using fit players who had been granted regular playing time at their club however at times he was forced to compromise from this principle as the pool of players available in the relatively small nation did not always provide him viable substitute options denmark qualified both for the world cup and euro but despite impressive results in the group stage in both tournaments especially the win against reigning world cup winners france in denmark failed to advance any further at the world cup denmark was defeated by england in the round of and at euro they were eliminated in the quarterfinals against the czech republic for the world cup qualification denmark was paired with semifinalists turkey and eventual euro champions greece following a poor start to qualification denmark was trailing both turkey and ukraine after failing to qualify for the world cup morten olsen considered leaving the job having received several offers from club teams but decided to stay and extended his contract until after the world cup denmark failed to qualify for euro but qualified for the world cup by winning their qualifying group earning two wins against sweden and four points against portugal olsens contract was extended for two more years until euro at the world cup denmark was grouped with japan cameroon and the netherlands denmark lost the first match to the netherlands but then scored a victory against cameroon the game against japan however ended with a defeat in qualification for euro denmark was once again grouped with portugal denmark secured first place in the group qualifying directly for the final tournament out of eight qualifying matches denmark won six drew one and lost one resulting olsens contract to be extended until after the world cup at euro denmark were drawn in the proclaimed group of death group b alongside germany the netherlands and portugal after defeating the netherlands they lost to portugal requiring a win against germany to advance in the tournament despite michael krohndehlis equaliser denmark lost to germany and with portugal defeating the netherlands denmark was eliminated from the tournament after finishing third in group b denmark failed to qualify for the next two tournaments under olsen they finished second in their world cup qualifying group but failed to achieve a playoff berth as they were the worst uefa group runnersup after removing results against the lastplace teams in euro qualifying they finished third in their group behind albania and eventual winners portugal but lost to sweden in the playoffs when measuring the performance of the national team by winning share and earned points olsens reign of the denmark national team from july until january had at the time been the secondmost successful in the era of fulltime professional coaches which began in july as of january olsen had a winning share of and with three points for a victory and one for a draw an average of points per match in comparison richard mller nielsen still had the best record among the professional coaches of the national team with a winning share and an average of points per game hareide era new coach ge hareide presided over the danish campaign during the qualification stages denmark ranked number in the fifa world rankings at the time of the draw were drawn into group e alongside poland montenegro romania armenia and kazakhstan despite suffering early defeats to poland and montenegro the danes rallied and secured second

jedinak in a game that ended denmark secured qualification in their final group game playing out the only goalless draw in the entire tournament in the luzhniki stadium against france a result which saw both teams progress denmark faced croatia in the round of with the croats topping group d with three wins mathias jrgensen scored within the first minute of the game to give denmark the lead but mario mandzukic equalised only three minutes later leaving the teams equally perched at one goal apiece the match remained at after ninety minutes necessitating thirty minutes of extratime which still failed to separate the teams as luka modri saw his late penalty saved by goalkeeper kasper schmeichel as such the tie was to be decided with a penalty shootout with schmeichel and his croatian counterpart danijel subai positioning themselves on the line to face five penalties each croatia advanced as subai saved three shots from eriksen lasse schne and nicolai jrgensen respectively ivan rakiti scored the decisive penalty to eliminate the danes putting an end to their best world cup campaign since following the world cup denmark prepared for participation in the inaugural iteration of the uefa nations league having been drawn in league b against wales and the republic of ireland the tournament offers an alternative route of qualification for the european championship and world cup and increases the number of competitive games for international sides replacing friendlies owing to a dispute with the players union regarding the commercial rights of the players the danish football union named an entirely uncapped squad consisting of a mixture of futsal players and players from the danish nd division and the denmark series the third and fourth tier of danish football respectively in lieu of the regular side to face slovakia in a prenations league friendly and it was feared that the same squad would be used for the competitive fixture against wales the dispute arose due to the image rights of the players with hummel having the exclusive right to the manufacture and marketing of danish kits the dbu wanted to use individual players without explicit permissions in their advertising hareide would similarly not be involved with the side instead falling under the temporary management of john jensen with hasse kuhn serving as the assistant manager the danish fa was under a fouryear probationary period with uefa for having forfeited a womens world cup qualification game against sweden in due to a similar dispute with the womens team and a further violation could have resulted in denmark being prohibited from participation in either the uefa nations league or the european championship after a temporary agreement enabled the return of the regular players the danes won their first nations league fixture hareide managed denmark during uefa euro qualifying and won four matches drawing four more this meant denmark qualified for the tournament but due to the covid pandemic the tournament was postponed to and hareides contract expired on june he was replaced by kasper hjulmand hjulmand era at uefa euro denmark were beaten by finland in a match marked by christian eriksens heart attack in the nd minute which led to the match being suspended for over two hours in the following match denmark lost their second match to belgium despite initially taking the lead they avoided elimination in the final round of matches with an impressive victory against russia they therefore became the first team to qualify for the knockout phase of a european championship despite two opening defeats facing wales in the round of denmark won by a large margin which earned them a quarterfinal tie with the czech republic denmark

the halfhour mark before england equalised and subsequently won in extra time despite the elimination denmarks performance was widely praised by the sporting press in particular for its resilience in overcoming the difficult situation caused by eriksens heart condition in the first group match and for its highquality teamwork and attacking play in the uefa nations league a they finished second in their group only one point behind croatia and winning twice against world champions france denmark also qualified for the fifa world cup topping group f in the qualification campaign ahead of scotland

nevertheless the danish team managed to finish top of their group with wins draw and defeats and qualified for their th continental finals at uefa euro denmark qualified as runnersup in their group but were eliminated by germany in the round of following the tournament hjulmand resigned on july and his assistant morten wieghorst was named as the new manager on a shortterm contract until the end of team image supporters apart from the national team denmark is famous for its traveling fans known as roligans the movement emerged during the s as the declared opposition to hooliganism the goal of the roligan movement is calm yet cheerful support during the matches as rolig means calm in the danish language the roligans have since developed an image of easygoing nature and rabid support and are often considered amongst the worlds best national team fans along with the tartan army of scotland they were collectively given the fifa fairplay award at the european championships the term roligan was invented by the editors of the danish newspaper bt in and later included in the danish dictionary just before the world cup the roligan movement was organized in order to support the national team at the tournament the reputation of the danish supporters was sullied by an attack from a fan which occurred in june in the euro qualifying match against sweden when an enraged danish supporter invaded the pitch and tried to attack the referee following his decision to hand out a red card for christian poulsen and a penalty kick to sweden in the last minute of the match the attacking fan was stopped by some of the danish football players on the field before he reached the referee but due to the episode the match was immediately cancelled by the referee with uefa subsequently deciding to award a default defeat to denmark as punishment rivalry denmarks main rival is sweden the countries have played against each other times of which denmark have won drawn and lost the first match between the teams was an denmark win in may denmark won their first five matches against sweden before their first defeat in october the first competitive match between the countries was a loss for denmark in the group stage of uefa euro both teams advanced from the group stage and denmark went on to win the tournament in uefa euro the teams drew in the last group match ensuring that both teams advanced at the expense of italy in denmarks home match against sweden in the qualification for uefa euro the visitors were awarded a win after a danish fan invaded the pitch and attacked the referee the reverse fixture ended in a goalless draw and denmark failed to qualify for the final tournament in the qualification for the fifa world cup denmark won both matches against sweden and qualified for the world cup in the playoff round of the qualification for uefa euro denmark lost to sweden on aggregate and failed to qualify for the finals the most recent match between the countries was a win for denmark in june kit the team kit is produced by danish company hummel it is allred with white details to reflect the colours of the danish national flag prior to the period of adidas sponsorship the kit provider was also hummel from to broadcast all of denmarks qualification nations league and friendly matches are broadcast by tv on television dr holds the rights on radio transmission home stadium the first home match for the denmark national team was a friendly win over england on may taking place with spectators at the stadium kbs baner located in the area granen where the forum copenhagen later was built as the facilities were considered too small a new stadium in copenhagen was built with the name idrtsparken since its opening on may it has hosted all the home matches of the football club kb and most of the home matches of the national team during the first years of the national team from october until november denmark played a total number of alevel home matches of which were played in idrtsparken among all the played home matches in idrtsparken denmark achieved victories draws and defeats the stadium reached a record of spectators for the game against sweden in june in regards of the first era from to only home matches were played at other stadiums than idrtsparken of which took place at aarhus idrtspark then known as atletion in aarhus followed by aalborg stadion in aalborg with six games and the remaining five matches hosted by four other stadiums whenever another stadium than idrtsparken was used for a home match it was only for some of the less important friendly games or olympic qualifiers while only idrtsparken was used to host the matches related to bigger tournaments like the nordic championship the european championship and world cup when a major rebuild of idrtsparken began in december the subsequent two official euro qualification matches were moved to odense stadium in odense on september the rebuilt idrtsparken now called parken and later renamed telia parken for sponsorship reasons became the biggest venue in denmark with a capacity of spectators and was opened with a friendly defeat against germany this first match in parken was viewed by spectators while the current stadium record of spectators was set on october for a world cup qualifying match against greece the capacity of the stadium was later reduced to seats after the upper part of the dside was converted from extra seats into office and vip areas in june despite this decrease in capacity the stadium is today still the biggest venue in denmark by far the next largest venue brndby stadium only has a capacity of seats from september to may parken was the sole stadium of all the mens senior national team matches however meagre spectator support at some of the friendly matches at parken which from to attracted an acceptable average of per match but down to for the friendly win over israel in april prompted the dbu to start hosting many of the friendly matches to other stadiums around denmark these other stadiums had less spectator capacity than parken but just about enough to cover the danes somewhat lesser interest for friendly matches on may parkens year monopoly on national team matches was broken for the first time when denmark played a friendly match at the aarhus idrtspark against upcoming world cup participants paraguay tickets to this match were sold out quickly with almost of the tickets sold within the first hour of sale and was supportwise a big success with a total audience of spectators when the two next friendly matches were played at other new venues such as a match on august at fionia park in odense against poland and on september at brndby stadium against portugal the number of spectators dropped the poland match attracted only spectators while the portugal match had only fans in particular the portugal match was deemed as a supportwise failure because it featured a higherranked opponent which spectators normally would have a high interest to watch the main reasons why brndby stadium failed to attract a high number of spectators were generally thought to be a combination of the poor rainy weather and the fact the stadium is located on the outskirts of copenhagen and as such does not attract a new demographic audience compared to parken due to the travel distances being more or less the same for the majority of the population currently while most of the friendly matches continue to be played at some of the smaller stadiums in denmark it has been decided to continue playing all of the qualifying matches for the european championships and world cup only at parken stadium those friendly matches which are believed to create a high interest from spectators will also continue to be played at parken for example the friendly against germany in august was played at parken stadium due to the high expectation of spectators desiring to watch the match however after denmarks performance at the world cup the friendly only drew spectators from september to january denmark played a total of alevel matches at parken stadium of which were won were drawn and lost results and fixtures the following is a list of match results in the last months as well as any future matches that have been scheduled win draw loss fixture coaching staff when the national team is assembled and train together ahead of a match the team is coached by as of october managers the responsibility and job description for the manager of the denmark national football team has changed throughout the history from to the dbu preferred to assign a manager with the overall responsibility this was followed by a long era from to where either no manager or only a caretaker manager was assigned when the dbu assigned arne srensen november december and poul petersen january december as managers for a rolling period of several years they were given the responsibility to coach the physical training and decide the team tactics before and during each match but had no influence upon the selection of players for the national squad which was a job for the speciallyappointed selection committee the udtagelseskomiten from to the management of the team more or less became a sole responsibility for the udtagelseskomiten following a new approach in this new approach the job to select players continued to be the responsibility for the udtagelseskomiten but the chairman of the committee was now also appointed to be the tactical manager of the national team as the dbu realized the need of having a special tactical manager assigned to get influence upon both the selection of players and the related tactics before and during the game however the appointed tactical manager did not have the responsibility to train the squad as a special physical coach was instead selected for that job in the approach with two managers assigned was again abandoned when the dbu realized the need to assign only one manager with the sole responsibility for the squad from to the job to select players was not yet a sole responsibility of the manager alone but only a shared responsibility as this continued to be a matter for the udtagelseskomiten to decide when a selection of players had to be made it was decided by a vote in the committee with the appointed manager being granted an influence of three votes and the four members of the committee being granted one vote each this special selection procedure continued until july where it was decided to award the sole responsibility of all

body for football in wales they have been a member of fifa since and a member of uefa since wales have qualified for the fifa world cup twice in and in they reached the quarterfinals before losing to eventual champions brazil they then went years before reaching their second major tournament when following a rise of places from an alltime low of th to a peak of th in the fifa world ranking between august and october they qualified for uefa euro where they reached the semifinals before again losing to the eventual champions portugal a second successive uefa european championship followed when wales reached the round of of uefa euro they also progressed through uefa euro qualifying to the quarterfinals though this was played on a twolegged homeandaway basis and is not considered part of the finals tournament historically the welsh team has featured a number of players from wales top club teams cardiff city and swansea city these two welsh clubs play in the english league system alongside fellow welsh clubs newport county wrexham and merthyr town however most welsh football clubs play in the welsh football league system as a country of the united kingdom wales is not a member of the international olympic committee as welsh athletes compete for great britain and therefore the national team does not compete in the olympic games history the early years wales played its first competitive match on march against scotland in glasgow making it the thirdoldest international football team in the world although the scots won the first fixture a return match was planned in wales the following year and so it was that the first international football match on welsh soil took place at the racecourse ground wrexham on march scotland took the spoils winning wales first match against england came in a defeat at the kennington oval london and in wales faced ireland for the first time winning in wrexham the associations of the four home nations met at the international football conference in manchester on december to set down a set of worldwide rules this meeting saw the establishment of the international football association board ifab to approve changes to the rules a task the four associations still perform to this day the season saw the formation of the british home championship a tournament which was played annually between england scotland ireland and wales until wales were champions on occasions winning outright seven times whilst sharing the title five times the faw became members of fifa world footballs governing body in but the relationship between fifa and the british associations was fraught and the british nations withdrew from fifa in in a dispute over payments to amateur players as a result wales did not enter the first three fifa world cups in wales played host to the republic of ireland the first time they played against a side from outside the four home nations one year later wales played a match outside the united kingdom for the first time when they travelled to paris to play france national football team in a match drawn after world war ii wales along with the other three home nations rejoined fifa in and took part in the qualifying rounds for the world cup the home championships being designated as a qualifying group the top two teams were to qualify for the finals in brazil but wales finished bottom of the group world cup the s were a golden age for welsh football with stars such as ivor allchurch cliff jones alf sherwood jack kelsey trevor ford ronnie burgess terry medwin mel charles and john charles wales made their first world cup finals tournament appearance in the fifa world cup in sweden however their path to qualification was unusual having finished second to czechoslovakia in qualifying group the golden generation of welsh football managed by jimmy murphy seemed to have missed out on qualification but the politics of the middle east subsequently intervened in the asianafrican qualifying zone egypt and sudan had refused to play against israel following the suez crisis while indonesia had insisted on meeting israel on neutral ground as a result fifa proclaimed israel winners of their group however fifa did not want a team to qualify for the world cup finals without actually playing a match and so lots were drawn of all the secondplaced teams in uefa belgium were drawn out first but refused to participate and so then wales was drawn out and awarded a twolegged playoff match against israel with a place in sweden for the winners having defeated israel at the ramat gan stadium and at ninian park cardiff wales went through to a world cup finals tournament for the first time the strong welsh squad made their mark in sweden drawing all the matches in their group against hungary mexico and sweden before defeating hungary in a playoff match to reach the quarterfinals against brazil however wales chances of victory against brazil were hampered by an injury to john charles that ruled him out of the match wales lost with yearold pel scoring his first international goal the goal made pel the youngest world cup goal scorer and brazil went on to win the tournament wales remarkable campaign in sweden was the subject of the bestselling book when pele broke our hearts wales and the world cup by mario risoli st davids press which was published on the th anniversary of the world cup and was also the inspiration for a bafta cymrunominated documentary s wales failed to qualify for the first four finals tournaments of the uefa european championship from its inception in they also did not replicate their success in qualifying for the fifa world cup although they did achieve a highly creditable draw against then world champions england in the british home championship weeks before england went to defend their title in mexico fifa world cup this helped to give wales a share of the home championship trophy for the year goal difference not at that stage being used to determine an outright winner in the team managed by mike smith reached the quarterfinals of the uefa european championship having finished top of qualifying group ahead of hungary austria and luxembourg but this was not considered part of the finals prior to only four countries qualified for the finals tournament and wales were drawn to play against the winners of group yugoslavia in a twolegged homeandaway tie wales lost the first leg in zagreb and were eliminated from the competition following a draw in a badtempered return leg at cardiffs ninian park which was marred by crowd trouble this initially led to wales being banned from the tournament but this was reduced on appeal to a fouryear ban on qualifying matches being played within miles of cardiff yugoslavia went on to finish fourth in the tournament the following year wales defeated england on english soil for the first time in years and secured their only victory to date at wembley stadium thanks to a leighton james penalty wales went onto finish second in the british home championship a few weeks earlier wales achieved another noted victory against then european champions czechoslovakia with nick deacy and james again scoring this victory in a qualifier strengthened wales bid to qualify for the fifa world cup but six months later that attempt ended in controversial circumstances the decisive fixture against scotland nominally a home fixture for wales although relocated to anfield amidst security concerns was swung by a contentious penalty awarded to scotland replays suggesting the handball offence may have actually been perpetrated by scottish striker joe jordan another notable achievement for wales however came in the british home championship as wales comprehensively defeated england at the racecourse ground goals from mickey thomas ian walsh leighton james and an own goal by phil thompson saw wales defeat england just four days after england had defeated the thenworld champions argentina s in the fifa world cup qualifiers the wales team managed by mike england came extremely close to qualification a defeat against the soviet union in their final match meant they missed out on goal difference but the real damage had been done by their failure to beat iceland in their last home match the match eventually finishing after several holdups due to floodlight failures wales also only narrowly missed out on qualification for the uefa european championship they were seconds away from qualification when a winning goal by ljubomir radanovi for yugoslavia during injury time in the final game of qualifying group against bulgaria eliminated wales mark hughes marked his debut for wales by scoring the only goal of the match as england were defeated once again in the following season hughes was again on target scoring a wonder goal as wales thrashed spain at the racecourse during qualification for the world cup however despite defeating scotland at hampden park it was again iceland that wrecked welsh hopes by defeating wales in reykjavk and for the second world cup in a row wales missed out on goal difference wales had to win their last match at home to scotland to be guaranteed at least a playoff but were held to a draw in a match marred by the death of scotland manager jock stein who collapsed from a heart attack at the end of the match wales also started strongly in their bid to qualify for the uefa european championship and were undefeated after four games but away defeats against denmark and czechoslovakia in the last two games in qualifying group saw mike englands eightyear reign as welsh coach end in another disappointment s under coach terry yorath wales achieved a remarkable result on june when defeating then world champions germany in a euro qualifier thanks to a goal from ian rush three months later on september wales achieved a notable double by defeating brazil for the only time in a friendly international thanks to a goal from dean saunders at this point wales seemed well placed to progress from their qualifying group however victories for germany in their three remaining matches in the group including a win in the return fixture against wales eliminated the welsh wales also made a strong showing in their qualifying group for the world cup achieving a noted victory at home to belgium wales thus attained what was then their highest position in the fifa world rankings on august wales again came close to qualifying for a major championship only to fall short in the closing stages of their campaign needing to win the final match of the group at home to romania on november paul bodin missed a penalty when the scores were level the miss was immediately followed by romania taking the lead and going on to win following the failure to qualify yoraths contract as manager of the national side was not renewed by the faw and real sociedad manager john toshack was appointed on a parttime basis however toshack resigned after just one match a defeat to norway citing problems with the faw as his reason for leaving although he was sure to have been shocked at being booed off the pitch at ninian park by the welsh fans still reeling from the dismissal of yorath mike smith took the manager role for the second time at the start of the euro qualifiers but wales slipped to embarrassing defeats against moldova and georgia before bobby gould was appointed in june goulds time in charge of wales is seen as a dark period by welsh football fans his questionable tactics and public fallingsout with players nathan blake robbie savage and mark hughes coupled with embarrassing defeats to club side leyton orient and a thrashing by the netherlands in did not make him a popular figure within wales gould finally resigned following a defeat to italy in and the faw turned to two legends of the national team neville southall and mark hughes to take temporary charge of the match against denmark four days later with hughes later being appointed on a permanent basis s under mark hughes wales came close to qualifying for a place at euro in portugal being narrowly defeated by russia in the playoffs however the defeat was not without its controversy as russian midfielder yegor titov tested positive for the use of a banned substance after the first qualifying leg a scoreless draw in moscow notwithstanding fifa opted not to take action against the football union of russia other than instructing them not to field titov again and the russian team went on to defeat wales in cardiff to qualify for the final tournament following a disappointing start to the world cup qualifying campaign hughes left his role with the national team to take over as manager of premier league outfit blackburn rovers john toshack was appointed manager for the second time in november in euro qualifying wales finished th in group d in fifa world cup qualification uefa group two home defeats by finland and germany in spring effectively ended wales hopes of qualification wales were drawn in uefa euro qualifying group g after a defeat at montenegro in their opening match on september john

wales the match was a culmination of speeds efforts which led wales to receive the unofficial award for biggest mover of in the fifa rankings his tenure as manager ended in tragic circumstances two weeks later when he was found dead at his home on november having apparently committed suicide due to londons successful bid for the summer olympics a great britain team would qualify as of right of being the host nation however the faw stressed it was strongly against the proposal despite this welsh players aaron ramsey and gareth bale expressed their interest in representing the great britain olympic football team bale withdrew due to injury but ramsey was joined by four other welshmen in stuart pearces man squad swansea citys joe allen and neil taylor while manchester uniteds ryan giggs

the world cup where they reached the quarterfinals after beating czechoslovakia in the playoff they were knocked out by france losing in the competition northern ireland became the least populous country to have qualified for the world cup a record that stood until trinidad and tobago qualified for the world cup northern ireland remains however the least populous country to have qualified for more than one world cup finals tournament to win a world cup finals match and to have progressed from the first round of the world cup finals captain of the national side at the world cup was danny blanchflower who also captained tottenham hotspur in the english league and was twice footballer of the year in england his younger brother jackie was also a key member of the national team and won

another manchester united player for the s and s northern ireland failed to qualify for any major tournaments northern ireland also qualified for the world cup their opening game was against yugoslavia at la romareda stadium in zaragoza it was the international debut of yearold norman whiteside who became the youngest player ever in the world cup finals a record that still stands the game finished goalless five days later they drew with honduras which was a disappointment and many believed had doomed northern irelands chances of advancing in the competition they needed a win against hosts spain in the third and final group game at the mestalla stadium in valencia they faced a partisan atmosphere with a mostly spanish crowd and a spanishspeaking referee in hctor ortiz who was unwilling to punish dirty play from the spanish players a mistake from spain goalkeeper luis arconada however gifted gerry armstrong the only goal of the game and despite having mal donaghy sent off on minutes northern ireland went on to record a historic win and top the first stage group a draw with austria at the vicente caldern stadium meant that a win against france would take them into the semifinals however a french team inspired by michel platini won and eliminated northern ireland from the competition they also qualified for the world cup where they went out in the group stages billy bingham a member of the squad was manager for both of these tournaments they have not qualified for any other world cups since recent history lawrie sanchez was appointed in january after a run of games without a goal under the previous manager sammy mcilroy which was a european record for any international team until san marino went over games without scoring between october and august that run ended after his first game in charge a loss to norway in a friendly in february the run of games without a win ended after his second game a victory in a friendly over estonia with a largely experimental side in march on september northern ireland beat england in a world cup qualifier at windsor park david healy scored the winner in the rd minute almost a year later on september northern ireland defeated spain in a qualifier for uefa euro with healy scoring a hattrick in june nigel worthington was named manager in the place of lawrie sanchez who took over at fulham initially worthington took over until the end of the euro qualifiers but was later given a contract until the end of the euro qualifiers michael oneill became manager in february after worthington had resigned in october after a poor euro qualification campaign the northern ireland team qualified for its first ever uefa european championship euro in france after years without qualifying for a major tournament after beating greece at windsor park on october at the tournament northern ireland were beaten by poland on june followed by a win against ukraine on june and finally a loss against germany in the group stage that was enough to qualify for a round of spot where they lost to wales due to an unfortunate own goal by gareth mcauley stadium northern ireland play their home matches at windsor park belfast home of linfield which they have use of on a year lease giving the owners of revenue including gate receipts and tv rights there was a proposal to build a multisports stadium for northern ireland at the disused maze prison outside lisburn for the use of rugby gaelic games and football this plan was given an in principle goahead by the irish football association however it was opposed by fans over of whom in a match day poll conducted by the amalgamation of northern ireland supporters clubs aonisc preferred to stay at a smaller new or redeveloped ground in the city of belfast the aonisc organised a protest against the move to the maze at the game against estonia in march the issue assumed ever greater urgency by following a series of inspections which questioned the suitability of windsor park to host international football following a reduction of capacity due to the closure of the railway stand the ifa made it known that they wished to terminate their contract for the use of the stadium a report on health and safety in october indicated that the south stand might have to be closed for internationals which would further reduce the stadiums capacity to in april belfast city council announced that they had commissioned drivers jonas to conduct a feasibility study into the building of a sports stadium in belfast which could accommodate international football which was followed at the beginning of may by speculation that the maze stadium project was going to be radically revised by peter robinson the finance and personnel minister in the northern ireland assembly so that any construction might be used for purposes other than football rugby union and gaelic games given the time that is needed to build a new stadium in the absence of significant work improving windsor park it seemed to be likely that northern ireland might be forced to play their home games at a venue outside northern ireland for a period in march proposals were announced for the construction of a new seat stadium in the sydenham area of east belfast as an alternative to the maze proposal this would form part of a major development with links to both george best belfast city airport and the bangor railway line the development would also include a hotel and retailleisure areas the stadium itself would be used for both football and rugby union with glentoran and ulster rugby intended as tenants ulster gaa however who were a partner in the maze proposal stated that in the event of a new stadium being built in east belfast which is a major unionist area their preference would then be to remain at casement park in nationalist west belfast the ifa were initially noncommittal about any of the proposals for improving their facilities be it rebuilding windsor park or supporting either the maze or sydenham proposals in september however they issued an announcement in favour of the redevelopment of windsor park although there were no specifics to this linfield had previously released a study with two proposals of which the major one would be a million rebuilding of the stadium raising the spectator capacity to in the northern ireland executive allocated million for a major programme of stadium redevelopment throughout northern ireland with million allocated to the redevelopment of windsor park in june further details of the stadiums redevelopment were released the plan was to redevelop windsor park into an allseater stadium with a series of phased works originally intended to begin in the summer of the redevelopment would include the demolition of the existing east and south stand structures to be replaced by new purpose built stands that would partially enclose the stadium complete renovation of the existing north and west stands and construction of both new conferencing facilities and a new headquarters facility for the ifa in february planning permission for the redevelopment was granted the cost of the project was estimated to be around million of which million would come from government funding it was initially planned for the work to begin in september two months later however irish premiership club crusaders began legal proceedings to have the process judicially reviewed as owners of the site rivals linfield were in line to receive not only a redeveloped stadium but also per annum from the ifa in land rent instead of the existing agreement which entitled linfield to of match revenue crusaders believed this to be against european union competition law as well as a form of state aid towards linfield in a hearing that took place on may crusaders request was granted it was ruled that it was a possibility for the redevelopment to be classed as state aid towards linfield the aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however was dismissed in july crusaders agreed to a possible settlement brought forward by the judicial review the details of the settlement were not made public but crusaders said that it had the potential to benefit the entirety of the football family in september sports minister carl n chuiln said that she was still committed to making sure the redevelopment went ahead as scheduled after previously stating that she would not sign off on the funding until the ifa resolved governance issues surrounding david martins return to the role of deputy president in december three months after the work was originally scheduled to begin the redevelopment was finally given the green light the sports minister signed off on million to complete the project the redevelopment finally got under way on may after the domestic season had finished eight months later than originally planned the work was completed in team image colours northern ireland football teams traditional colours are green white and azure blue green has long been a traditional symbolic colour for ireland the azure blue comes from st patricks blue which was adopted as the colour of the

production duo blonde going on to reach number seven in the itunes uk top historic controversy over sectarianism a small element of northern irelands support was in the past regarded as sectarian in the ifa launched the football for all campaign to tackle sectarianism and racism at northern ireland games michael boyd the director of football development at the ifa recalled how the team struggled to even get a sponsor for their kit because the image of northern irish football was so poor attendance at matches was low at a game against france then reigning world cup champions ifa could not sell out the ground and there were problems with sectarian singing and racist abuse neil lennon a roman catholic celtic player who had been subject to sectarian abuse from northern ireland fans while playing for northern ireland in windsor park was issued a death threat by loyalists and retired from international football in as a result former security minister jane kennedy said the threat against lennon disgraced northern ireland in the eyes of the world and widened the divide between the association and catholic players and supporters however the incident represented a turning point in the campaign against sectarianism in the ifa which had seen slow progress in the previous two years steps taken to eradicate the sectarian element within the support have been successful lennon has been quick to praise these initiatives he also praised the football for all outstanding achievement award winner stewart macafee for the work he has done to create a more inclusive atmosphere at international games people like stewart are the unsung heroes who have been brave enough to challenge sectarianism and who have actively created a more fun safe and familyorientated atmosphere at international games fans like stewart have made the atmosphere at northern ireland football games in recent years the envy of fans across not only europe but world football from a personal point of view i would like to thank them for their efforts in northern irelands supporters were awarded the brussels international supporters award for their charity work general good humour and behaviour and

ireland team also existed this was overseen by the irish football association ifa and had previously been the sole national team for the entire island of ireland in fifa decreed that for competitive matches in tournaments that both irish teams could enter the fai team would be officially called republic of ireland while the ifa team was to be named northern ireland northern ireland was allowed to keep using the title ireland by fifa in the british home championship which was discontinued in the republic of ireland was the first nation from outside the united kingdom to defeat england at home in a fixture played at goodison park liverpool in the team reached the quarterfinal stage of the european nations cup where they lost to the eventual champions spain under the guidance of jack charlton the team enjoyed their most successful era reaching their highest fifa world ranking ever at sixth in august and qualifying for uefa euro in their first appearance at the uefa european championship reaching the quarterfinals of the fifa world cup in their first appearance at the finals as well as making the last at the edition charltons successor mick mccarthy lost out on the next two major tournaments but ultimately qualified for the world cup making it to the last a feat repeated at the euros by manager martin oneill the teams home stadium is the aviva stadium in dublin although some of their home games have been played in other stadiums across the country their traditional colours are green shirts and white shorts the position of manager was filled by heimir hallgrmsson samus coleman has served as team captain since history ss between and ireland was represented by a single national football team organised by the belfastbased irish football association ifa in ireland was partitioned into northern ireland and the irish free state the latter in turn becoming ire or ireland after adopting a new constitution in followed by declaring itself a republic in following the initial political upheavals surrounding partition a dublinbased organisation calling itself the football association of the irish free state faifs split from the ifa in and began organising its own league and national football team in the faifs was recognised by fifa as the governing body of football in the irish free state and at the summer olympics the irish free state made their international debut on may at the stade olympique they beat bulgaria with paddy duncan scoring the teams firstever goal as a result they qualified for the quarterfinals where they lost to the netherlands on june the irish free state made their home debut against the united states who had embarked on a brief european tour after competing in the same summer olympics ed brookes scored a hattrick in a home win at dalymount park the irish free state did not play their next game until march an away game against italy lost in subsequent years the status of the olympic games football competition was downgraded and as a result this game is widely regarded as the irish free states first official game on february the irish free state made their fifa world cup debut drawing with belgium at dalymount park in a fifa world cup qualifier paddy moore scored all four of the free states goals and became the first player ever to score four goals in a world cup game after they reverted to the designation football association of ireland and began to refer to their team as ire or ireland during this entire period there were two irish international football teams chosen by two rival associations both associations the northern irelandbased ifa and the irish free statebased fai claimed jurisdiction over the whole of ireland and considered themselves entitled to select players from the entire island at least dual internationals were selected to represent both teams however the overwhelming majority of these were southerners who also agreed to play for the ifa team with only a bare handful crossing the border in the other direction a win over england at goodison park on september was the first time england suffered a home defeat by a team outside the home countries of scotland wales and the ireland team run by the belfastbased irish fa fifa eventually intervened when both teams entered world cup qualification the first time they had entered the same competition four players tom aherne reg ryan davy walsh con martin actually played for the two different teams in the same fifa world cup tournament all four players concerned had been born in the irish free state and made their full international debut in fai colours before agreeing to represent the ifa team this may have alarmed the fai since they subsequently lobbied fifa to prevent the ifa from picking southernborn players as well as attempting to exert pressure on the players themselves sometimes through their clubs fifas response was to restrict the eligibility of players on the basis of the political border further ruling in that neither team could be referred to as ireland in competitions which both teams were eligible to enter ie initially the fifa world cup and subsequently the european nations cup now the uefa european football championship fifa decreed that the fai team officially be called the republic of ireland while the ifa team was to be named northern ireland the world cup qualifiers saw the republic of ireland drawn with england in their home game against england alf ringstead put the hosts up before john atyeo equalised in the last minute to salvage a draw for england under the rules of the day a win for the republic of ireland would have meant a playoff with england for a place in the world cup after reaching the quarterfinals of the european nations cup the republic of ireland was drawn to face spain and syria in world cup qualifying despite syrias withdrawal this was still considered a qualifying group with the irish winning at home and losing away this meant a playoff at the parc des princes in paris which spain won eamon dunphy made his ireland debut in this game the playoff was originally scheduled to take place at wembley stadium in london home to a large irish diaspora but the fai agreed with the royal spanish football federation to have the match moved to paris where a large spanish diaspora lived the fai was criticised for this move to boost revenue from gate receipts in the republic of ireland team made history when selecting manchester united fullback shay brennan for the senior national team this was the first instance of a player born outside the republic being selected to play for the national team due to having an irish parent since then many of the republics most prominent players have been born in england including mark lawrenson david oleary john aldridge tony cascarino and david kelly a number of players born in scotland including ray houghton have since represented the republic due to having irish parentage the selection rules were later relaxed to allow for the selection of players with an irish grandparent in the fai appointed mick meagan as the first permanent manager of the national side his two years in charge were marked by exceptionally poor results however with the team losing five out of six matches and gaining just one point in their world cup qualification and doing no better in the uefa euro qualifiers leading to his dismissal his replacement liam tuohy did a somewhat better in the qualification and more importantly oversaw major improvements to the national teams training facilities and persuaded many english club sides to end their policies of not releasing irish players for international games during the domestic season ultimately however the team still failed to qualify for the world cup and tuohy resigned following a dispute over his wages johnny giles became the sides first playermanager in the s this was followed by the debut of a young liam brady and results improved markedly the side missed out on the world cup by two points having defeated france at home during qualification after a less than impressive performance at euro qualifying in which the team finished well behind group winners england and northern ireland giles resigned saying that he had taken the national side as far as he could eoin hand took over as manager for the world cup qualifiers and once more the republic of ireland narrowly missed out on qualification this time on goal difference behind france whom they had defeated at home once more disappointing qualifying campaigns for both euro and the world cup followed ending hands time in charge the golden generation in the republic of ireland appointed jack charlton a top rated english manager who had been part of englands world cupwinning side of during the s he had developed middlesbrough into a side which provided many players to the dominant liverpool team of the time after taking charge of the republic of ireland charlton influenced changes in the national side which resulted in the most successful period of its history qualifying for two world cups and a european championship prominent players in this period included paul mcgrath packie bonner niall quinn and the liverpool trio of ray houghton john aldridge and ronnie whelan irelands first appearance at a major finals tournament came in euro with irelands fixtures already complete qualification was secured through gary mackays thminute goal in sofia when scotland beat bulgaria the scottish win left ireland top of the group in spite of the enforced absence of liam brady and mark lawrenson from their squad in the finals in west germany ireland shocked europe by beating england in stuttgart with a header from ray houghton in their competitive debut drew with the soviet union in hannover with ronnie whelan the scorer and lost to eventual champions the netherlands in gelsenkirchen coming within seven minutes of a draw that would have meant a semifinal place the republic of irelands longest competitive winning streak was achieved in during the world cup qualifying campaign five games against spain northern ireland hungary and malta twice were all wins subsequently the side made it to the world cup in italy three draws in the group stage against england egypt and the netherlands were enough to make the knockout stage virtually the entire country watched as they beat romania on penalties with packie bonner making a vital save and david oleary scoring the decisive spotkick ireland was then beaten by hosts italy in the quarterfinal at the stadio olimpico in rome during the tournament the team had an audience with pope john paul ii the only team to do so after missing out on euro despite being unbeaten in qualifying the republic of ireland qualified for the world cup held in the united states via a qualification group which again included spain and northern ireland and ended with the republic finishing above european champions denmark by a very narrow margin goals scored in their first match at the finals they beat the previous world cup hosts and thirdplace finishers italy in their opening game at giants stadium just outside new york city but lost to mexico at the citrus bowl in the heat and humidity of orlando florida they ended the group stage with a draw with norway at giants stadium in east rutherford new jersey with these results they made it to the second round eventually losing to the netherlands in orlando ireland finished second behind portugal in euro qualifyings group but narrowly missed out on the euro finals after losing to the netherlands in the qualifying playoff anfield in liverpool was chosen as the neutral venue for the match between the two worstranked group runnersup with patrick kluivert scoring both goals to send his team through it was jack charltons final game as manager post golden generation and decline charlton was replaced by mick mccarthy but ireland still missed out on the next two major tournaments ireland just managed to finish second to romania in their world cup qualification campaign after tony cascarino scored a late goal to win the away match with lithuania a playoff with belgium followed with the match at lansdowne road finishing in a draw the match in belgium finishing to the home team and substitute david connolly being sent off in the latter preventing ireland from progressing to the world cup fifa awarded the fifa fair play award for to the irish supporters for their exemplary behaviour at ireland team matches especially the fifa world cup qualifying playoffs against belgium irelands opponents in uefa euro qualifying group were yugoslavia croatia malta and north macedonia then known as fyro macedonia see macedonia naming dispute north macedonia scored a lastminute equaliser that denied ireland top spot in the group instead they faced turkey in a playoff to decide which team would participate in euro the match in dublin finished in a draw although turkey qualified through the away goals rule after a draw at the end of which tony cascarino became involved in a fight and retired from international football ireland took on both portugal and the netherlands in world cup qualifiers in uefas group ending the group in second place with points from matches seven victories and three draws despite this unbeaten run ireland were drawn in a playoff with iran the match in dublin finished in a victory to ireland with goals from ian harte penalty and robbie keane while the match in tehran played in front of spectators finished in a win for iran mccarthy thus managed to lead ireland to the world cup final stages though only for the team to lose inspirational captain roy keane due to the pairs infamous public spat in saipan draws with cameroon and germany were followed by a victory over saudi arabia in group e the irish once again progressed to the knockout stage only losing narrowly on penalties to spain in suwon after robbie keanes last minute equalising penalty kick forced the game into extra time after a poor start to qualifying for euro mccarthy was replaced by brian kerr but he too struggled to guide the side to the tournament or the subsequent world cup in germany and was ultimately sacked in october kerr was replaced by steve staunton assisted by bobby robson in the position of international football consultant in january under staunton results varied widely but the team still failed to qualify for euro and staunton lost the position in october his reign included a humiliating defeat to cyprus during the qualifiers group d one of the worst defeats in the teams history trapattoni oneill spells in charge and mick mccarthys return giovanni trapattoni was appointed manager in february following a spell with assistant coach don givens in charge trapattoni went through all ten first round world cup qualifying games unbeaten winning four of the ten games

republic of ireland a playoff place at least with hopes of automatic qualification still a reality going into the final group game against poland in warsaw a win or a draw of or more would guarantee at least second place in the group and ensure automatic qualification for the finals in france the republic of ireland however lost thus entering them into the playoffs the draw for the euro playoff

herzegovina the top seeded team in the playoff the only previous meeting between the teams resulted in a win for the republic of ireland in a friendly in shane long scoring the games only goal owing to injuries and suspensions ireland had only the b squad available for the first leg of the playoff played in bilino polje stadium a goal from robbie brady almost secured a victory for the irish until

impressive victories over georgia and moldova on november ireland beat austria in vienna to go top of the world cup qualifying group however a run of three draws against wales austria and georgia followed by a devastating loss at home to serbia looked to have diminished any chances of the republic of ireland qualifying for the world cup the republic of ireland were soon back on form however after securing a victory at home to moldova thanks to a brace from daryl murphy on october ireland defeated wales in cardiff to qualify for the qualification playoffs after a james mcclean goal fired

the announcement of the rebuilding of lansdowne road a new venue was required to stage the republic of irelands home internationals the only stadium in ireland deemed suitable to stage international football was the capacity croke park home of the gaelic athletic association gaa to accommodate this the gaa temporarily relaxed its rule governing the playing of foreign games on its property initially four uefa euro qualifying group d matches were played at croke park in resulting in two wins and two draws the gaa initially agreed to allow the fai use until the end of and later extended

controversially sold them in a multimillion deal to sky sports a subscription based satellite channel the decision was criticised by fans and politicians and the consumers association of ireland cai described the fai as greedy the fai was eventually forced to reverse its decision and to allow rt to continue its broadcasts after the government intervened to stop the sale of important irish sporting events to nonterrestrial television broadcasters rt for qualifiers and eir sport for friendlies will hold the rights until selection and nationality issues the selection of young players born in northern ireland especially those who have already represented northern ireland at youth level into republic of ireland national teams has been controversial as these players are able to claim irish nationality even though born and brought up outside the republics territory this has led to accusations of unfairness and predatory behaviour in northern ireland it is seen by northern ireland supporters as having the effect of dividing international football in their country along sectarian lines whereby nationalists will declare for the republic of ireland while unionists continue to play for northern ireland it has also been argued that it is actually the sectarian divisions which already existed in northern irish football that are a factor in a number of players switching to the republic the switches of darron gibson and james mcclean brought matters to a head in the s as a previous unspoken reluctance to be seen to pilfer players and some ambiguity on the rules broke down after the good friday agreement clarified in both british and irish law the right of anyone born in northern ireland to irish citizenship as a birthright fifa accepting this gave any northern born players the right to switch to play for the republic unless they had a full competitive cap for northern ireland traditionally those in northern ireland who identify as irish predominantly catholics

from until the teams have met only nine times since then most recently in a friendly in september scotland have qualified for the fifa world cup on eight occasions and the uefa european championship four times but they have never progressed beyond the first group stage of a finals tournament the team have achieved some noteworthy results such as beating the fifa world cup winners england at

the match ended in a goalless draw all eleven players who represented scotland that day played for glasgow amateur club queens park over the next forty years scotland played matches exclusively against the other three home nationsengland wales and ireland the british home championship began in making these games competitive the encounters against england were particularly fierce and a rivalry quickly developed scotland lost just two of their first international matches it was not until a home defeat by ireland in that scotland lost a match to a team other than england this run of success meant that scotland would have regularly topped the elo ratings which were calculated in between and scotland won the british home championship outright on occasions and shared the title times with at least one other team a noteworthy victory for scotland before the second world war was the victory over england in which led to that scotland side being known as the wembley wizards scotland played their first match outside the british isles in beating norway in bergen scotland continued to contest regular friendly matches against european opposition and enjoyed wins against germany and france before losing to the austrian wunderteam and italy in scotland like the other home nations did not enter the three fifa world cups held during the s this was because the four associations had been excluded from fifa due to a disagreement regarding the status of amateur players the four associations including scotland returned to the fifa fold after the second world war a match between a united kingdom team and a rest of the world team was played at hampden park in to celebrate this reconciliation s entering the world cup the readmission of the scottish football association to fifa meant that scotland were eligible to enter the fifa world cup fifa advised that places would be awarded to the top two teams in the british home championship but the sfa announced that scotland would only attend the finals if scotland won that competition scotland won their first two matches but a home defeat by england meant that the scots finished as runnersup scotland had qualified by right for the world cup but had not met the demand of the sfa to win the championship the sfa stood by this proclamation despite pleas to the contrary by the scotland players supported by england captain billy wright and the other england players the sfa instead sent the team on a tour of north america the same qualification rules were in place for the fifa world cup and scotland finished second in the british home championship this time the sfa allowed the team to participate in the world cup but its preparation was atrocious the sfa only sent players to the finals even though fifa allowed man squads despite this selfimposed hardship in terms of players sfa dignitaries travelled in numbers accompanied by their wives scotland lost against austria in their first game in the finals which prompted the team manager andy beattie to resign hours before the game against uruguay uruguay were reigning champions and had never before lost a game at the world cup finals and they defeated scotland the fifa world cup finals saw scotland draw their first game against yugoslavia but they then lost to paraguay and france and went out at the first stage matt busby had been due to manage the team at the world cup but the severe injuries he suffered in the munich air disaster meant that trainer dawson walker took charge of the team instead s ian mccoll and home championship successes under the management of ian mccoll scotland enjoyed consecutive british home championship successes in and jock stein john prentice and malky macdonald all had brief spells as manager before bobby brown was appointed in browns first match as manager was against the newly crowned world champions england at wembley stadium despite being underdogs scotland won thanks to goals from denis law bobby lennox and jim mccalliog having defeated the world champions on their own turf the scotland fans hailed their team as the unofficial world champions despite this famous win the scots failed to qualify for any major competitions during the s s world cups and ally macleod after tommy dochertys brief spell as manager willie ormond was hired in ormond lost his first match in charge to england but recovered to steer scotland to their first world cup finals in years in at the world cup finals in west germany scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a world cup tournament the team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference after beating zare they drew with both brazil and yugoslavia and went out because they had beaten zare by the smallest margin scotland appointed ally macleod as manager in with qualification for the world cup in argentina far from assured the team made a strong start under macleod by winning the british home championship largely thanks to a victory over england at wembley the scotland fans invaded the pitch after the match ripping up the turf and breaking a crossbar scotlands form continued as they secured qualification for the world cup with victories over czechoslovakia and wales during the buildup to the fifa world cup macleod fuelled the hopes of the nation by stating that scotland would come home with a medal as the squad left for the finals in argentina they were given an enthusiastic sendoff as they were paraded around a packed hampden park thousands more fans lined the route to prestwick airport as the team set off for south america scotland lost their first game against peru in crdoba and drew the second against newcomers iran the disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of macleod in the dugout with his head in his hands these results meant scotland had to defeat the netherlands by three clear goals to progress despite the dutch taking the lead scotland fought back to win with a goal from kenny dalglish and two from archie gemmill the second of which is considered one of the greatest world cup goals ever gemmill beat three dutch defenders before lifting the ball over goalkeeper jan jongbloed into the net the victory was not sufficient to secure a place in the second round and scotland were eliminated on goal difference for the second successive world cup s jock stein and alex ferguson macleod resigned as manager shortly after the world cup and jock stein who had won nine consecutive scottish league titles and the european cup as manager of celtic was appointed as his successor after failing to qualify for the european championship scotland qualified for the fifa world cup from a tough group including sweden portugal israel and northern ireland

difference after a draw with the soviet union scotland qualified for the fifa world cup their fourth in succession in traumatic circumstances the squad went into their last qualification match against wales needing a point to progress to a qualifying playoff against australia with only nine minutes remaining and wales leading scotland were awarded a penalty kick which was calmly scored by davie cooper the draw meant that scotland progressed but as the players and fans celebrated stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards his assistant alex ferguson took over scotland qualified by winning against australia in a twoleg playoff but were eliminated from the tournament with just one point from their three matches a goalless draw with uruguay following defeats by denmark and west

in a defeat by romania away from home left qualification dependent upon other results but a draw between bulgaria and romania in the final group match saw scotland squeeze through despite playing well in matches against the netherlands and germany and a fine win against the cis the team was knocked out at the group stage scotland failed to qualify for the fifa world cup the team finished fourth in their qualifying group behind italy switzerland and portugal when it became clear that scotland could not qualify andy roxburgh resigned from his position as team manager new manager craig brown successfully guided scotland to the european championship tournament the first game against the netherlands ended raising morale ahead of a much anticipated game against england at wembley gary mcallister missed a penalty kick and a goal by paul gascoigne led to a defeat scotland recovered to beat switzerland with a goal by ally mccoist england taking a lead in the other match briefly put scotland in a position to qualify but a late goal for the netherlands meant that they advanced instead of scotland on goals scored brown again guided scotland to qualification for a major tournament in and scotland were drawn against brazil in the opening game of the world cup john collins equalised from the penalty spot to level the score at but a tom boyd own goal led to a defeat scotland drew

qualify for the fifa world cup finishing third in their qualifying group behind croatia and belgium this second successive failure to qualify prompted craig brown to resign from his position after the final qualifying match the sfa appointed former germany manager berti vogts as browns successor scotland reached the qualification playoffs for euro where they beat the netherlands at hampden park but suffered a defeat in the return leg poor results in friendly matches and a bad start to the world cup qualification caused the team to drop to a record low of th in the fifa world rankings vogts announced his resignation in blaming the hostile media for his departure walter smith a former rangers and everton manager was brought in to replace vogts improved results meant that scotland rose up the fifa rankings and won the kirin cup a friendly competition in japan scotland failed to qualify for the fifa world cup finishing third in their group behind italy and norway smith left the national side in january to return to rangers with scotland leading their euro qualification group new manager alex mcleish guided scotland to wins against georgia the faroe islands lithuania france and

criticism from the media after the team lost their first qualifier against macedonia after scotland lost their fourth match to the netherlands captain barry ferguson and goalkeeper allan mcgregor were excluded from the starting lineup for the following match against iceland due to a breach of discipline despite winning against iceland scotland suffered a defeat by norway in the following qualifier which left scotland effectively needing to win their last two games to have a realistic chance of making the qualifying playoffs scotland defeated macedonia in the first of those two games but were eliminated by a loss to the netherlands in the second game burley was allowed to continue in his post after a review by the sfa board but a subsequent friendly defeat by wales led to his dismissal s

consecutive domestic double on november man city were beaten by brighton hove albion meaning that for the first time in his managerial career guardiola had suffered four losses in a row in normal time manager profile tactics although much emphasis is placed on retaining possession of the ball and dictating play with the intent to have the opposing sides defence chase the ball for extended periods of play guardiolas teams are recognised for pressing off the ball players press and harry the opposition collectively in an attempt to win back possession of the ball this collective press is only conducted in the starting third of the oppositions pitch where less space exists and defenders andor the goalkeeper may not be as good at dribbling or passing the ball as a midfielder as high pressing became prominent guardiola sought to counteract it with goalkeepers and defenders comfortable with controlling the ball and both long and short ball distribution with goalkeepers such as victor valds and manuel neuer also acting as sweeperkeepers at barcelona and bayern munich rushing off their line to prevent counterattacks and playing out from the back at manchester city ederson routinely played accurate long balls upfield when city were pressed high at times taking the entire opposition outofplay and creating on situations for city forwards to avoid getting caught by longrange passing from citys defensivethird the opposition defence would cautiously drop deep despite the forward lines highpress hence creating space in the middle of the pitch guardiola has stated he tries to constantly evolve his tactics after learning the style analogous with total football under johan cruyff guardiola was particularly influenced by his time as a player in mexico under his friend and manager at dorados juan manuel lillo guardiola also sought help of marcelo bielsa to learn from him his editorials for el pais during the world cup in praise of luis aragons spanish side and ricardo la volpes mexican side reveal the extent of his reverence for possessionbased attacking football with defenders along with the goalkeeper playing it out from the back which guardiola later cited as a major inspiration on multiple occasions in one of his editorials he called zinedine zidane frances best defender pointing out how recycling possession in itself is a key defensive tactic something that guardiola teams would later become synonymous with philipp lahm who played for guardiola at bayern munich pointed out that guardiolas tactics were majorly an offensive sacchi modelled after the arrigo sacchis milan team of the late s emphasising fluid movement quick recoveries and keeping possession of the ball which was in sharp contrast to the strictlydefensive catenaccioinspired style employed effectively by jos mourinho and later by diego simeone and that guardiola has evolved his approach that seemingly was now a mix of both those styles tactics employed by guardiola have been likened to gegenpressing invented by ralf rangnick and used to great effect by jrgen klopp his tactics have influenced approaches of managers such as maurizio sarri thomas tuchel graham potter and luis enrique as well as those of other sports such as rugby guardiola admitted that he had to adapt his style to german and english leagues but his football education comes from catalunya which is possessionbased and distinct from gegenpressing while several pundits have often linked guardiolas attackingminded tactics at barcelona centred around quick passing ball possession movement a high defensive line and heavy pressing to the tikitaka style employed by the spanish national side under aragons at euro guardiola himself has refuted this claim and has even been critical of the system commenting in i loathe all that passing for the sake of it all that tikitaka its so much rubbish and has no purpose you have to pass the ball with a clear intention with the aim of making it into the oppositions goal its not about passing for the sake of it guardiola has been praised by pundits for his flexibility as a coach and has used several formations throughout his career at barcelona he often used a formation with inverted wingers and attacking fullbacks who would overlap and provide width to the team as well as a formation on occasion he also later used these formations at bayern munich and manchester city in the formation defensive midfielders sergio busquets at barcelona and xabi alonso at bayern mnich would occasionally drop back into the backline to act as an additional defender this role was similar to the one guardiola himself played under cruyff at barcelona at bayern mnich he also used fullbacks phillip lahm and joshua kimmich in midfield guardiola also began to use a false during his time at barcelona fielding lionel messi in the centre of the teams attacking line who would drop deep into midfield to give the team a numerical advantage in the middle of the pitch at manchester city after experimenting with several formations he used a modern version of the formation during the treblewinning season which was likened to the past wm formation he deployed centreback john stones in a hybrid defensive and creative role in midfield which jonathan wilson of the guardian likened to both the libero and winghalf roles in guardiola also used inverted fullbacks who moved inside to occupy central areas of the pitch while he also played in a more physical and direct style than in previous seasons utilising erling haaland as a traditional striker reception considered by pundits to be one of the greatest managers of all time guardiola is often linked with the successes of the spanish and german national teams in s both of whom had many firstteam players that were coached by him jrgen klopp credits guardiola with building the toughest teams he has ever faced stating i could say city are the toughest opponent ive ever had but it wasnt much easier when i faced peps bayern we push each other to insane levels in italian defender giorgio chiellini was critical of guardiolas philosophy however and expressed his belief that the popularisation of possessionbased playing styles associated with barcelona under guardiola and the increasing focus on developing defenders who are comfortable with the ball at their feet from a young age in italy had in fact had a negative impact on their overall defensive quality he commented guardiolismo a term he coined for the guardiola way has ruined a generation of italian defenders a bit now everyone is looking to push up defenders know how to set the tone of play and they can spread the ball but they dont know how to mark several of guardiolas former players teammates and coaching staff members such as xabi alonso xavi luis enrique erik ten hag and mikel arteta have pursued coaching careers and have cited guardiola as an inspiration personal life guardiola was born to dolors and valent he has two older sisters and a younger brother pere guardiola a football agent he is an atheist guardiola met his wife cristina serra when he was they married on may they have three children named maria mrius and valentina following his tenure as barcelonas manager he stated that he would move to the united states to live in manhattan new york for a year until he had decided on his future to prepare for his position as

proindependence coalition junts pel s in that years regional parliamentary election on may guardiola made a cameo appearance in ted lasso in which ted lassos played by jason sudeikis team afc richmond

for the final after a poor performance in a league game against st johnstone dunfermline lost the final to celtic then failed to win the league by one point the season saw ferguson notch up goals in games for dunfermline along with joe mcbride of celtic he was the top goalscorer in the scottish league with goals ferguson then joined rangers for which was a record fee for a transfer between two scottish clubs he performed well in europe during his two seasons with the club scoring six goals in nine appearances in the intercities fairs cup including two against fc kln in the competition and an important strike against athletic bilbao in the edition which helped rangers into the semifinals but on both occasions they were knocked out by english opposition he was blamed for a goal conceded in the scottish cup final in a match in which he was designated to mark celtic captain billy mcneill and was subsequently forced to play for the clubs junior side instead of for the first team according to his brother ferguson was so upset by the experience that he threw his losers medal away there have been claims that he suffered discrimination at rangers due to his marriage to a catholic cathy holding ferguson said in a documentary film about his life and career sir alex ferguson never give in that he assumed that his exclusion from the first team after the cup final was due to her religion his autobiography noted that rangers had known of his wifes religion when he joined the club in march he added that when he was signed a rangers director had questioned whether the fergusons had been married in a catholic chapel and that the director had replied oh thats okay when told they had married in a registry office ferguson left rangers reluctantly as he had grown up locally and had dreamed of succeeding there he was upset by how newspapers would refer to him as an exrangers player after he had left and rarely attended gatherings of their former players the following october nottingham forest wanted to sign ferguson but his wife was not keen on moving to england at that time so he went to falkirk instead he remained at brockville for four years gaining more league appearances than he had elsewhere in recognition of his experience he was promoted to playercoach but when john prentice became manager he removed fergusons coaching responsibilities fergusons time at falkirk was soured by this and he responded by requesting a transfer and moved to ayr united where he finished his playing career in international fergusons only involvement with the scotland national team was during an overseas tour in for many years none of the tour matches were recognised by the scottish football association as full internationals and so ferguson was deemed to have never played for scotland a bbc sport article in june identified him as one of the best scottish players to have never played a full international the sfa announced in october that some of the tour matches would be reclassified as full internationals which meant that ferguson was belatedly awarded an international cap managerial career east stirlingshire in june ferguson was appointed manager of east stirlingshire at the comparatively young age of it was a parttime job that paid per week and the club did not have a single goalkeeper at the time he gained a reputation as a disciplinarian with club forward bobby mcculley later saying he had never been afraid of anyone before but ferguson was a frightening bastard from the start st mirren in october ferguson was invited to manage st mirren while they were below east stirlingshire in the league they were a bigger club and although ferguson felt a degree of loyalty towards east stirlingshire he decided to join st mirren after taking advice from jock stein ferguson was manager of st mirren from until producing a remarkable transformation of a team in the lower half of the old second division watched by crowds of just over to first division champions in discovering talent like billy stark tony fitzpatrick lex richardson frank mcgarvey bobby reid and peter weir while playing superb attacking football the average age of the league winning team was and the captain fitzpatrick was st mirren have the distinction of being the only club ever to sack ferguson he claimed wrongful dismissal against the club at an industrial tribunal but lost and was given no leave to appeal according to a sunday herald article on may the official version is that ferguson was sacked for various breaches of contract including unauthorised payments to players he was counteraccused of intimidating behaviour towards his office secretary because he wanted players to get some expenses tax free he did not speak to her for six weeks confiscated her keys and communicated only through a yearold assistant the tribunal concluded that ferguson was particularly petty and immature it was claimed during the tribunal by st mirren chairman willie todd that ferguson had no managerial ability in the guardian published an interview with todd then aged who had sacked ferguson many years earlier todd said that the fundamental reason for the dismissal was a breach of contract relating to ferguson having agreed to join aberdeen ferguson told journalist jim rodger of the daily mirror that he had asked at least one member of the squad to go to aberdeen with him he told the st mirren staff he was leaving todd expressed regret over what happened but blamed aberdeen for not approaching his club to discuss compensation in ferguson turned down the managers job at aberdeen the role went to billy mcneill who returned to celtic after only a year leaving the role available for ferguson once again aberdeen late s ferguson joined aberdeen as manager in june replacing billy mcneill who had only managed the club for one season before he was offered the chance to manage celtic although aberdeen were one of scotlands major clubs they had won the league only once in under dave halliday the team had been playing well however and had not lost a league match since the previous december having finished second in the league the previous season ferguson had now been a manager for four years but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as joe harper the season did not go especially well with aberdeen reaching the semifinal of the scottish cup and the scottish league cup final but losing both matches and finishing fourth in the league aberdeen lost the scottish league cup final this time to dundee united after a replay ferguson took the blame for the defeat saying he should have made changes to the team for the replay s and silverware aberdeen had started the season poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new year and they won the scottish league that season with a win on the final day it was the first time in years that the league had not been won by either rangers or celtic ferguson now felt that he had the respect of his players later saying that was the achievement which united us i finally had the players believing in me he was still a strict disciplinarian though and his players nicknamed him furious fergie he fined one of his players john hewitt for overtaking him on a public road and kicked a tea urn at the players at half time after a poor first half he was dissatisfied with the atmosphere at aberdeen matches and deliberately created a siege mentality by accusing the scottish media of being biased towards the glasgow clubs to motivate the team the team continued their success with a scottish cup win in ferguson was offered the managers job at wolverhampton wanderers but turned it down as he felt that wolves were in trouble and his ambitions at aberdeen were not even half fulfilled european success and scottish national side ferguson led aberdeen to even greater success the following season they had qualified for the european cup winners cup as a result of winning the scottish cup the previous season and impressively knocked out bayern munich who had beaten tottenham hotspur in the previous round according to willie miller this gave them the confidence to believe that they could go on to win the competition which they did with a victory over real madrid in the final on may aberdeen became only the third scottish team to win a european trophy and ferguson now felt that hed done something worthwhile with his life this was followed up with victory in the european super cup in december when hamburger sv the reigning european cup champions were beaten over two legs aberdeen had also performed well in the league that season and retained the scottish cup with a victory over rangers but ferguson was not happy with his teams play in that match and upset the players by describing theirs as a disgraceful performance in a televised interview after the match a statement he later retracted after a substandard start to the season aberdeens form improved and the team won the scottish league and retained the scottish cup ferguson was appointed an officer of the order of the british empire obe in the new year honours and was offered the managers jobs at rangers and arsenal during the season aberdeen retained their league title in the season in aberdeen won both domestic cups but finished fourth in the league ferguson had been appointed to the clubs board of directors early in but that april he told dick donald their chairman that he intended to leave that summer ferguson had been part of the coaching staff for the scottish national side during qualifying for the world cup but manager jock stein had collapsed and died on september at the end of the game in which scotland qualified from their group for a playoff against australia ferguson promptly agreed to take charge of the scottish national side against the australians and subsequently at the world cup to allow him to fulfil his international duties he appointed archie knox as his comanager at aberdeen however after scotland failed to progress past the group stages of the world cup ferguson stepped down as national team manager on june around this time tottenham hotspur offered ferguson the chance to take over from peter shreeves as manager but he rejected this offer and the job went to luton towns david pleat instead there was also an offer for ferguson to replace don howe as arsenal manager but he rejected this offer as well and fellow scot george graham took the post instead that summer there had been speculation that he would take over from ron atkinson at manchester united who had slumped to fourth in the english top flight after a tenmatch winning start it was not the first time that ferguson had been linked with a move to england in february wolverhampton wanderers had approached him about succeeding john barnwell as manager as they were heading for relegation from the first division he rejected this offer perhaps concerned about the clubs financial stability as they were more than million in debt at the time and narrowly avoided going out of business at the end of the season it was reported that ferguson was being considered for the liverpool managers job after the retirement of joe fagan was announced but the job was quickly accepted by liverpool striker kenny dalglish although ferguson remained at aberdeen over the summer he did eventually join manchester united when atkinson was sacked in november manchester united appointment and first fa cup title ferguson was appointed manager at old trafford on november he was initially worried that many of the players such as norman whiteside paul mcgrath and bryan robson were drinking too much and was depressed by their level of fitness but he managed to increase the players discipline and united climbed up the table to finish the season in th place having been st second from bottom when he took over his first game in charge was a defeat at oxford united on november followed seven days later by a goalless draw at newly promoted norwich city and then his first win at home to queens park rangers on november results steadily improved as the season went on and by the time they recorded what would be their only away win of the league campaign at title challengers and rivals liverpool on boxing day it was clear that united were on the road to recovery the year began on a high note with a victory over newcastle united and united gradually pulled together in the second half of the season with relatively occasional defeats on the way and finished th in the final table fergusons mother elizabeth died of lung cancer aged three weeks after his appointment ferguson hired archie knox his assistant at aberdeen in the same role at manchester united in in the season ferguson made several major signings including steve bruce viv anderson and brian mcclair the new players made a positive contribution to a united team who finished in second place nine points behind liverpool liverpools points lead however had been in double digits for most of the season and while united had lost only five league games all season they drew games leaving some way to go before united could match their northwestern rivals during the season united played two friendly matches in bermuda against the bermuda national team and the somerset cricket club in the match against somerset both ferguson himself and his assistant archie knox took to the field with knox even getting on the scoresheet the match was fergusons only appearance for the manchester united first team united were expected to do well when mark hughes returned to the club two years after leaving for barcelona alongside jim leighton from aberdeen but the season was a disappointment for them finishing th in the league and losing at home to nottingham forest in the fa cup sixth round they had begun the season slowly going on a ninematch winless run throughout october and november with one defeat and eight draws before a run of generally good results took them to third place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid february however another run of disappointing results in the final quarter of the season saw them fall down to midtable for the season ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for midfielders neil webb mike phelan and paul ince as well as defender gary pallister and winger danny wallace the season began well with a win over defending champions arsenal on the opening day but uniteds league form quickly turned sour in september united suffered a humiliating away defeat against fierce rivals manchester city following this and an early season run of six defeats and two draws in eight games a banner declaring three years of excuses and its still crap tara fergie was displayed at old trafford and many journalists and supporters called for ferguson to be sacked ferguson later described december as the darkest period he had ever suffered in the game as united ended the decade just outside the relegation zone following a run of seven games without a win manchester united were drawn away to nottingham forest in the third round of the fa cup forest were performing well that season and were in the process of winning the league cup for the second season running and it was expected that united would lose the match and ferguson would consequently be sacked but united won the game due to a mark robins goal and eventually reached the final this cup win is often cited as the match that saved fergusons old trafford career united went on to win the fa cup beating crystal palace in the final replay after a draw in the first match giving ferguson his first major trophy as manchester united manager uniteds defensive frailties in the first match were blamed on goalkeeper jim leighton ferguson dropped leighton for the replay bringing in les sealey uniteds european firsts and fergusons seconds although uniteds league form improved greatly in they were still inconsistent and finished sixth there were some excellent performances that season including a demolition of arsenal at highbury but results like an early loss at newly promoted sunderland a september hammering by liverpool at anfield and a home defeat by everton in early march the game where yearold talented prospect ryan giggs made his senior debut showed that united still had some way to go even after the fa cup victory in the previous season some still had doubts about fergusons ability to succeed where all the other managers since matt busby had failed to win the league title they were runnersup in the league cup losing to sheffield wednesday however they won the european cup winners cup beating that seasons spanish champions barcelona it would be uniteds only cup winners cup title after the match ferguson vowed that united would win the league the following season and at long last he seemed to have won over the last of his sceptics after nearly five years in the job during the close season fergusons assistant archie knox departed to rangers to become assistant to walter smith and ferguson promoted youth team coach brian kidd to the role of assistant manager in knoxs place he also made two major signings goalkeeper peter schmeichel and defender paul parker to bolster his side there was much anticipation about the breakthrough of the young ryan giggs who had played twice and scored once in the campaign and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of lee sharpe who despite their youth had made ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and buying a new player to take over from the disappointing danny wallace on the left wing he had also added soviet midfielder andrei kanchelskis to the right wing giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders mike phelan and bryan robson the season did not live up to fergusons expectations and in fergusons words many in the media felt that his mistakes had contributed to the misery united won the league cup and european super cup both for the first time but lost out on the league title to rivals leeds united after leading the table for much of the season a shortage of goals and being held to draws by teams they had been expected to beat in the second half of the campaign had proved to be the undoing of a united side who had performed so well in the first half of the season ferguson felt that his failure to secure the signing of mick harford from luton town had cost united the league and that he needed an extra dimension to the team if they were to win the league the following season during the close season ferguson went on the hunt for a new striker he first attempted to sign alan shearer from southampton but lost out to blackburn rovers he also made at least one approach for the sheffield wednesday striker david hirst but manager trevor francis rejected all offers and the player stayed put in the end he paid million for yearold cambridge united striker dion dublin his only major signing of the summer after a slow start to the season by sitting th at the beginning of november it looked as though united would miss out on the league title yet again however after the purchase of french striker eric cantona from leeds for million the future of manchester united and fergusons position as manager began to look bright cantona formed a strong partnership with mark hughes on april united were second in the league when they faced sheffield wednesday at home united were losing with four minutes to go before steve bruce equalised after minutes of injury time which was subsequently dubbed fergie time alluding to extra minutes allegedly being granted to fergusons teams to get a goal bruce scored the th minute winner with ferguson celebrating the goal by running from his dugout on to the touch line while assistant brian kidd ran on to the field seen as being a decisive victory it put united top of the league where they remained winning the title ended uniteds year wait for a league title and also made them the first premier league champions united finished with a tenpoint margin over runnersup aston villa whose defeat at oldham athletic on may had given united the title ferguson was later voted manager of the year by the league managers association double win and loss the season brought more success ferguson added nottingham forests yearold midfielder roy keane to the ranks for a british record fee of million as a long term replacement for bryan robson who was nearing the end of his career united led the premier league table virtually from start to finish ferguson was the first winner of the premier league manager of the month award introduced for the start of the season when he collected the accolade for august cantona was top scorer with goals in all competitions despite being sent off twice in the space of five days in march united also reached the league cup final but lost to aston villa managed by fergusons predecessor ron atkinson in the fa cup final manchester united achieved an impressive scoreline against chelsea winning ferguson his second league and cup double following his scottish premier division and scottish cup titles with aberdeen in though the league cup final defeat meant that he had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with aberdeen in ferguson made only one closeseason signing paying blackburn million for david may there were newspaper reports that ferguson was also going to sign highly rated yearold striker chris sutton from norwich city but the player headed for blackburn instead was a harder season for ferguson cantona assaulted a crystal palace supporter in a game at selhurst park and it seemed likely he would leave english football an eightmonth ban saw cantona miss the final four months of the season he also received a day prison sentence for the offence but the sentence was quashed on appeal and replaced by a hour community service order united paid a british record fee of million for newcastle uniteds prolific striker andy cole with young winger keith gillespie heading to the northeast in exchange the season also saw the breakthrough of young players gary neville nicky butt and paul scholes who provided excellent cover for the long periods that united were left without some of their more experienced stars however the championship slipped out of manchester uniteds grasp as they drew with west ham united on the final day of the season when a win would have given them a third successive league title united also lost the fa cup final in a defeat by everton ferguson was heavily criticised in the summer of when three of uniteds star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought first paul ince moved to internazionale of italy for million longserving striker mark hughes was sold to chelsea in a million deal and andrei kanchelskis was sold to everton ferguson felt that united had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team the youngsters who would be known as fergies fledglings included gary neville phil neville david beckham paul scholes and nicky butt who would all go on to be important members of the team and so the season began without a major signing at a time when the likes of arsenal liverpool and newcastle were making the headlines with bigmoney signings a youthful united team lost in their opening league game of the season against aston villa on match of the day pundit alan hansen criticised their performance ending his analysis with the words you cant win anything with kids united won their next five matches and were boosted by the return of cantona who made his comeback against liverpool in october for much of the season the team trailed league leaders newcastle and found themselves ten points behind by christmas this later was narrowed to seven points after defeating them on december the gap increased to points but a series of wins coupled with newcastle dropping points meant by late march united moved to the top of the table in a televised outburst after his teams win against leeds newcastle manager kevin keegan responded angrily to fergusons comments were still fighting for this title and hes got to go to middlesbrough i would love it if we beat them love it a win against middlesbrough on the final day sealed the title for united and the team beat liverpool by a goal to nil to win the fa cup final this was their second double in three years a week after the cup final ferguson agreed a fouryear contract to remain at united united started the following season thrashing the previous years league runnersup newcastle in the charity shield they went on to win their fourth league title in five seasons at the end of the campaign made easier by the fact that their rivals were not up to the job under ferguson the team made a better go in the champions league and reached the semifinal stage for the first time in years united did not advance any further after defeat by borussia dortmund of germany norwegian signings ole gunnar solskjr and ronny johnsen were the notable additions to the squad with the former ending the season as the clubs top goalscorer in may cantona informed ferguson of his decision to retire from football the player felt exploited by uniteds merchandising department and questioned the ambition of the club reasons which ferguson understood striker teddy sheringham was signed as cantonas replacement from tottenham hotspur with blackburn defender henning berg the other significant purchase that summer in the close season united appointed keane as their new captain ferguson described him as the best allround player in the game after the teams fa charity shield win and believed keane had all the right ingredients to succeed from cantona defeat by leeds united in september was the teams first league loss in seven months keane during the match injured himself and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season with ligament damage goalkeeper peter schmeichel was placed as captain in his absence by november united opened up a fourpoint lead in the league which prompted talk of whether any team could catch them after arsenals defeat of united in the same month ferguson acknowledged a onehorse race was not good for the game and admitted his opponents deserved to win on their secondhalf performance the fallibilities of liverpool chelsea and blackburn as league challengers allowed united during the winter to extend their lead by points albeit with arsenal having gamesinhand this was enough for manchester bookmaker fred done to pay out on punters who backed the champions retaining their title arsenal collected maximum points sealing the title with a win against everton on may ferguson congratulated his opponent arsne wenger who in his first full season at the club later completed the double i think its good for my young players to lose on this occasion i wholeheartedly acknowledge what arsenal achieved between christmas and the end of the season united straight after paid million for psv defender jaap stam a new club record fee ferguson wanted to strengthen the squads attacking options and identified aston villas dwight yorke as his main target attempts to sign yorke were rebuffed at first before ferguson persuaded edwards to increase uniteds initial offer of million a million deal was reached a week into the league campaign yorke signed minutes before the deadline to submit uniteds squad for the champions league treble success united opened the season with a loss to arsenal in the fa charity shield the beating did not concern ferguson though he described his teams defeat by arsenal in september as a lot less tolerable in december kidd left his role as assistant to become the manager of blackburn rovers ferguson instructed eric harrison and les kershaw to find suitable replacements in terms of coaching ability and work ethic both recommended steve mcclaren the assistant to jim smith at derby county mcclaren was fergusons initial choice and appointed him in february his first game as assistant was uniteds victory over nottingham forest ferguson felt uniteds bid to regain the premier league began indifferently because of their commitments to other competitions he was willing to pay for the progress made in the champions league the team finished second in their champions league group of death behind bayern munich and ahead of barcelona uniteds win against liverpool in the fa cup fourth round was a portent for the remainder of the season a goal down after three minutes the team equalised in the th minute and scored the winning goal through solskjr in stoppage time on reflection ferguson said it was a demonstration of the morale that was to be every bit as vital as rich skill in the five months that lay ahead of united in the final weeks of the league season arsenal emerged as a creditable challenger to united both clubs were also paired together in the semifinal of the fa cup decided by a replay as the original game finished goalless keane was sent off in the second half and united conceded a penalty late into the match with the score dennis bergkamps effort was saved by peter schmeichel ferguson hoped his team could at least take it to a penalty shootout but instead the match was settled in extra time giggs ran the length of the pitch and evaded several arsenal players to score the winning goal united went on to beat newcastle united in the fa cup final and completed the double a week earlier the team had regained the premiership title uniteds progression in the champions league was promising compared to previous seasons the team eliminated inter milan at the quarterfinal stage and faced juventus in the last four of the competition a late goal scored by giggs in the first leg earned the team a draw but in spite of conceding an away goal ferguson was adamant of uniteds chances of reaching the final something tells me we are going to win the nature of our club is that we torture ourselves so much that the only way to get relief is by winning over there at the stadio delle alpi striker filippo inzaghi scored twice to put juventus up on aggregate keane headed in a beckham cross to halve the deficit just before halftime but was later shown a yellow card for a foul on edgar davids which prevented him from playing in the final yorke equalised before cole added a third to win the match outright keanes performance merited praise from ferguson it was the most emphatic display of selflessness i have seen on a football field pounding over every blade of grass competing if he would rather die of exhaustion than lose he inspired all around him i felt it was an honour to be associated with such a player days after the fa cup final united travelled to barcelona the setting for the uefa champions league final ferguson contemplated his team selection against bayern munich suspensions to scholes and keane ruled both players out of the match beckham was positioned in centre midfield while giggs moved to the right wing and blomqvist started on the left changes the manager felt would prevent the opposition from playing narrow united conceded in the first six minutes of the final from a mario baslers free kick sheringham who came on for blomqvist equalised from a corner in the first minute of additional time mcclaren told ferguson to get the team organised for extra time to which he replied steve this game isnt finished three minutes into added time solskjr scored the winner which for united completed an unprecedented treble ferguson interviewed moments after said i cant believe it football bloody hell but they never gave in and thats what won it he and schmeichel the standin captain jointly lifted the cup during the trophy presentation a crowd of over people turned out on the streets of manchester to greet the players who paraded through the city in an opentop bus as european champions united were invited to play in the intercontinental cup the club also entered the inaugural club world championship which was held in brazil this brought about a potential fixture congestion so united accepted the fas recommendation of withdrawing from the fa cup the first holders to do so in later years ferguson elaborated on the clubs decision we did it to help englands world cup bid that was the political situation i regretted it because we got nothing but stick and terrible criticism for not being in the fa cup when really it wasnt our fault title hattrick retirement plan schmeichels decision to leave united after eight seasons prompted ferguson to bring in replacements mark bosnich from aston villa and italian massimo taibi the latter featured in four matches the last of which a defeat at chelsea in october he was not selected again by ferguson united ended the league season as champions with just three defeats and a record points margin of in december the club beat palmeiras in tokyo to win the intercontinental cup but a month later exited at the group stage of the inaugural club world championship although ferguson stated the tournament was fantastic united failed to retain the champions league as they lost in the quarterfinal stage to eventual winners real madrid ferguson sought to strengthen his squad and signed fabien barthez from monaco for million he also monitored the progress of ruud van nistelrooy a striker of the highest calibre he met the player and his agent in manchester to discuss formalities and was informed of van nistelrooys troubled right knee ferguson was not agitated by this he recalled from experience a similar niggle that did not stop his playing career van nistelrooy however failed his medical but ferguson reassured him that we might yet find a way out of the nightmare the deal was resurrected in april for a british record transfer fee of million in the season united retained the league title for a third season becoming only the fourth side in history to do so the achievement was overshadowed by reports of a rift between the clubs board and ferguson he told the clubs television channel mutv that he was prepared to sever all ties with the club once his contract ended the following year the decision has been taken im going to leave the club im disappointed with what has happened because i was hoping something would be sorted out it hasnt happened as i thought it would and thats all there is to it both parties eventually reached a compromise which pleased ferguson i am delighted weve settled this when you have been at the club as long as i have it gets in your blood age was one of the factors in fergusons decision to retire reaching acted as a psychological barrier it changed my sense of my own fitness my health in may mcclaren left to become middlesbrough manager with jimmy ryan being named assistant to ferguson for the duration of the campaign united once more broke their transfer record with the purchase of juan sebastin vern from lazio for a reported million in august stam was transferred to lazio for million the player reportedly moved because of claims in his autobiography head to head stam implied that ferguson illegally contacted him about a move to manchester united before informing psv ferguson said he sold the player because the club needed to cut back on its massive wage bill he replaced the defender with laurent blanc a long soughtafter target in an interview with alastair campbell eight years after ferguson described his biggest mistake at the club was letting go of jaap stam no question the club endured a poor first half to the season and languished in ninth position after a home defeat by west ham in december on the night of christmas day ferguson shelved his retirement plan his family convinced him to remain in charge of united and ferguson informed watkins of his uturn the following day once ferguson publicised his decision to remain in february uniteds form improved the team won out of matches though finished third in the league behind arsenal and liverpool united were unsuccessful in europe losing their champions league semifinal on away goals to bayer leverkusen early exits from the league cup and fa cup meant they ended the season trophyless ferguson himself said that the decision to announce his retirement had resulted in a negative effect on the players and on his ability to impose discipline rebuilding and transition in june ferguson appointed carlos queiroz as his new assistant the recommendation came from andy roxburgh at a time when united began scouting for southernhemisphere footballers and wanted a multilingual coach ferguson was so impressed with queiroz after their first meeting he offered him the job right away in july united paid million for leeds united defender rio ferdinand the club broke the british transfer record once more though this did not concern ferguson we have the right to try and improve ourselves and theres nothing wrong with that the season began rather poorly for united the club made their worst start to a league campaign in years in a column for the daily telegraph hansen said ferguson will recognise this difficult start to the season for what it is the greatest challenge of his career fergusons response was typically bullish i dont get paid to panic we have had plenty of stuttering starts my greatest challenge is not whats happening at the moment my greatest challenge was knocking liverpool right off their fucking perch and you can print that several players were sent away for surgery in this period a minor gamble ferguson took in the hope they would return energised defeats such as the one to manchester city at maine road in november forced united to change their playing style the team moved the ball forward more and quicker rather than concentrating on possession ratios and the coaching staff tried accommodating diego forln with ruud van nistelrooy before settling with paul scholes uniteds league form improved as the season went on despite defeat by liverpool in the football league cup final and they overhauled arsenal to win the premier league for an eighth time in may the team were eliminated in the champions league quarterfinal to real madrid over two legs ferguson described the second match a win at old trafford as epic after a season at united queiroz left to manage real madrid in june ferguson anticipated his deputy would return three months later he was wanting to quit madrid and for that reason did not appoint a replacement in the summer david beckham also moved to real madrid while juan sebastin vern joined chelsea united in the meantime rebuilt their team tim howard replaced barthez in goal and klberson eric djembadjemba and cristiano ronaldo came in to bolster the squad ronaldinho might have also joined had he not said yes then no to our offer in december rio ferdinand was banned from playing football for eight months after he failed to present himself at a drugs test ferguson in his autobiography ten years later blamed the drug testers who didnt do their job they didnt go looking for rio the absence of ferdinand hampered uniteds defence of the premier league in the season the team finished third behind arsenals invincibles and chelsea in europe they experienced defeat at the hands of eventual winners porto ferguson felt it was possible not because of the performance of the players but because of the referee who disallowed a legitimate scholes goal that would have been enough to progress united ended the campaign as fa cup winners beating millwall in the final at the beginning of the season teenage striker wayne rooney the worlds most expensive teenager at more than million and argentine defender gabriel heinze joined united while cristiano ronaldo continued where he had left off the previous season by putting in more matchwinning performances but the lack of a striker after ruud van nistelrooy spent most of the season injured saw the club finish third for the third time in four seasons in the fa cup they lost on penalties to arsenal in the final a secondround exit from the champions league at the hands of milan and a semifinal exit from the league cup at the hands of eventual winners chelsea who also clinched the premier league title meant that was a rare instance of a

quoted alex ferguson as saying they the bbc did a story about my son that was whole lot of nonsense it all sic madeup stuff and brown paper bags and all that kind of carryon it was a horrible attack

fergusons intimidation of referees resulted in socalled fergie time that is unusually generous injury time being added in matches where manchester united were behind the phrase is at least as old as but the concept first appeared on april when steve bruce scored a thminute goal seventh minute of injury time added on by the referee against sheffield wednesday to win the game for united they went top of the league with this win and remained there until the season ended the term got wider coverage when united came from behind to win the uefa champions league final with two goals in injury time the concept cropped up in the media and by opponents whenever games seemed to be having more injury time than expected a statistical analysis by the times suggests that this concept might be valid though the article points out that other footballing criteria may explain the correlation between extra added time and united being behind analysis by opta sports of premier league matches played between and found on average that seconds more time was played in matches where manchester united were losing this was a greater figure than for other top clubs although most of these clubs seem to benefit from a fergie time effect particularly in their home matches legacy many of fergusons former players have gone on to become football managers themselves including tony fitzpatrick alex mcleish

numbers outside the usual starting lineup numbers of to cruyff led the netherlands to a runnersup medal in the world cup and was named player of the tournament thanks to his teams mastery of total football they coasted all the way to the final knocking out argentina east germany and brazil along the way cruyff scored twice against argentina in one of his teams most dominating performances then he scored the second goal against brazil to knock out the defending champions the netherlands faced hosts west germany in the final cruyff kicked off and the ball was passed around the oranje team times before returning to cruyff who then went on a run past berti vogts and ended when he was fouled by uli hoene inside the box teammate johan neeskens scored from the spot kick to give the netherlands a lead and the germans had not yet touched the ball during the latter half of the final his influence was stifled by the effective marking of vogts while franz beckenbauer uli hoene and wolfgang overath dominated the midfield as west germany came back to win after cruyff retired from international football in october having helped the national team qualify for the upcoming world cup without him the netherlands finished runnersup in the world cup again initially there were two rumours as to his reason for missing the world cup either he missed it for political reasons a military dictatorship was in power in argentina at that time or that his wife dissuaded him from playing in cruyff stated to the journalist antoni bassas in catalunya rdio that he and his family were subject to a kidnap attempt in barcelona a year before the tournament and that this had caused his retirement to play a world cup you have to be okay there are moments when there are other values in life coaching career entry into management with ajax after retiring from playing cruyff followed in the footsteps of his mentor rinus michels in june cruyff returned to ajax again he coached a young ajax side to victory in the european cup winners cup in in the season the league title was lost to jan rekers psv despite ajax having a goal difference of goals for goals against in the and seasons ajax won the knvb cup it was during this period as manager that cruyff was able to implement his favoured team formationthree mobile defenders plus one more covering space becoming in effect a defensive midfielder from rijkaard blind silooy verlaat larsson spelbos two controlling midfielders from rijkaard scholten winter wouters mhren witschge with responsibilities to feed the attackminded players one second striker bosman scholten two touchlinehugging wingers from bergkamp vant schip de wit witschge and one versatile centre forward from van basten meijer bosman so successful was this system that ajax won the champions league in playing cruyffs system a tribute to cruyffs legacy as ajax coach return to barcelona as manager and building the dream team after having appeared for the club as a player cruyff returned to barcelona for the season this time to take up his new role as coach of the first team before returning to barcelona however cruyff had already built up plenty of experience as a coachmanager in the netherlands he was strongly praised for the attacking flair he imposed on his sides and also for his commendable work as talent spotter with bara cruyff started work with a completely remodelled side after the previous seasons scandal known as the hesperia mutiny el mot de lhespria in catalan his second in command was carles rexach who had already been at the club for a year cruyff immediately had his bara charges playing his attractive brand of football and the results did not take long in coming but this did not just happen with the first team the youth teams also displayed that same attacking style something that made it easier for reserve players to make the switch to first team football as sid lowe noted when cruyff took over as manager barcelona of the late s were a club in debt and in crisis results were bad performances were worse the atmosphere terrible and attendances down while even the relationship between the president of the club josep llus nez and the president of the spanish autonomous community they represented jordi pujol had deteriorated it did not work immediately but he cruyff recovered the identity he had embodied as a player he took risks and rewards followed at bara cruyff brought in players such as pep guardiola jos mari bakero txiki begiristain andoni goikoetxea ronald koeman michael laudrup romrio gheorghe hagi and hristo stoichkov with cruyff baran experienced a glorious era in the space of five years he led the club to four european finals two european cup winners cup finals and two european cupuefa champions league

win against manchester united in the champions league barcelona won a copa del rey in the european super cup in and three supercopa de espaa as well as finishing runnerup to manchester united and milan in two european finals with trophies cruyff was barcelonas most successful manager but has since been surpassed by his former player pep guardiola who achieved cruyff was also the clubs longestserving manager in his final two seasons however he failed to win any trophies falling out with chairman josep llus nez who ultimately sacked him as barcelona coach while still at barcelona cruyff was in negotiations with the knvb to manage the national team for the world cup finals but talks broke off at the last minute catalonia national team as well as representing catalonia on the

was advised to quit coaching by his doctors he left in and never took another top job but his influence did not end there though he vowed never to coach again he remained a vocal football critic and analyst cruyffs open support helped candidate joan laporta to victory in barcelonas presidential elections he continued to be an adviser for him although he held no official post at barcelona back in an advisory capacity alongside joan laporta he recommended the appointment of frank rijkaard in again barca was successful winning backtoback league titles and another champions league crown in after two relatively disappointing campaigns laporta survived a censure motion and an overhaul was needed in summer rijkaard left the club and even though jos mourinho was pushing for the job at camp nou cruyff chose pep guardiola many were quick to point to guardiolas lack of coaching experience but cruyff said the biggest test for a coach at a team like bara is the strength to make decisions and the ability to talk to the press because they dont help and you have to manage that after that its easy for those who know football but there arent many who know on march cruyff was named honorary president of barcelona in recognition of his contributions to the club as both a player and manager in july however he was stripped of this title by new president sandro rosell return to ajax as technical director on february in the wake of a major research on the tenyearmismanagement it was announced that cruyff would be the new technical director at his boyhood club ajax his fourth stint with the amsterdam club cruyff announced in march that he was pulling out of his planned return to ajax because of professional difference of opinion between him and ajaxs new manager marco van basten van basten said that cruyffs plans were going too fast because he was not so dissatisfied with how things are going now on february cruyff returned to ajax on an advisory basis after agreeing to become a member of one of three sounding board groups after presenting his plans to reform the club in particular to rejuvenate the youth academy the ajax board of advisors and the ceo resigned on march on june he was appointed to the new ajax board of advisors to implement his reform plans the ajax advisory board made a verbal agreement with louis van gaal to appoint him as the new ceo without consulting cruyff cruyff a fellow board member took ajax to court in an attempt to block the appointment the court overturned the appointment saying that the board had deliberately put cruyff offside due to the ongoing quarrel within the advisory board cruyff resigned on april with ajax stating that cruyff will remain involved with the implementation of his football vision within the club technical advisor for chivas guadalajara cruyff became a technical advisor for mexican club guadalajara in february jorge vergara the owner of the club made him the teams sport consultant in response to the losing record guadalajara sustained in the last few months of although signed to a threeyear contract cruyffs contract was terminated december after just nine months with the club guadalajara said that other members of the teams coaching staff would likely not be terminated ambassador for belgium and the netherlands joint bid to host the world cup in september cruyff and ruud gullit were unveiled as ambassadors for the belgiumnetherlands joint bid for the world cup finals in or at the official launch in eindhoven profile and legacy style of play the total footballer regarded as one of the greatest players in history and as the greatest dutch footballer ever throughout his career cruyff became synonymous with the playing style of total football it is a system where a player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team thus allowing the team to retain their intended organizational structure in this fluid system no footballer is fixed in their intended outfield role the style was honed by ajax coach rinus michels with cruyff serving as the onfield conductor space and the creation of it were central to the concept of total football ajax defender barry hulshoff who played with cruyff explained how the team that won the european cup in and worked it to their advantage we discussed space the whole time cruyff always talked about where people should run where they should stand where they should not be moving it was all about making space and coming into space it is a kind of architecture on the field we always talked about speed of ball space and time where is the most space where is the player who has the most time that is where we have to play the ball every player had to understand the whole geometry of the whole pitch and the system as a whole the team orchestrator cruyff was a creative playmaker with a gift for timing passes nominally he played centreforward in this system and was a prolific goalscorer but dropped deep to confuse his markers or moved to the wing to great effect in the world cup final between west germany and the netherlands from the kickoff the dutch monopolised ball possession at the start of the move that led to the opening goal cruyff picked up the ball in his own half the dutch captain who was nominally a centreforward was the deepest dutch outfield player and after a series of passes he set off on a run from the centre circle into the west german box unable to stop cruyff by fair means uli hoene brought cruyff down conceding a penalty scored by johan neeskens the first german to thus touch the ball was goalkeeper sepp maier picking the ball out of his own net this free centreforward role in which cruyff operated has retroactively been compared to the false position in contemporary football by pundits such as jamie rainbow of world soccer magazine due to the way cruyff played the game he is still referred to as the total footballer cruyff was known for his technical ability speed acceleration dribbling and vision possessing an awareness of his teammates positions as an attack unfolded football consists of different elements technique tactics and stamina he told the journalists henk van dorp and frits barend in one of the interviews collected in their book ajax barcelona cruyff there are some people who might have better technique than me and some may be fitter than me but the main thing is tactics with most players tactics are missing you can divide tactics into insight trust and daring in the tactical area i think i just have more than most other players on the concept of technique in football cruyff once said technique is not being able to juggle a ball times anyone can do that by practising then you can work in the circus technique is passing the ball with one touch with the right speed at the right foot of your team mate style of management and tactics cruyff is widely seen as a revolutionary figure in the history of ajax barcelona and the netherlands the offensive style of play cruyff introduced at barcelona later came to be known as tikitakacharacterised by short passing and movement working the ball through various channels and maintaining possessionwhich was later adopted by the euro fifa world cup and euro winning spain national football team as a manager cruyffs tactics were influenced by the dutch total football system in which he played a part during his playing career under his former manager michels cruyff often used a fluid formation at barcelona or occasionally the he often favoured technical players with good movement over physical players and used his players in seemingly unorthodox roles on occasion for example he made use of spanish midfielder pep guardiola in a defensive midfield role as a deeplying playmaker who would dictate play in midfield through his passing he would also occasionally drop deeper to act as an additional centreback cruyff also deployed danish playmaker michael laudrup in a free centreforward role due to his mobility positioning passing and tendency to be involved in the buildup of attacking plays and create chances for teammates laudrup would often drop deep into midfield which would disorient opposing defenders allowing other midfielders or offensive wingers such as stoichkov to exploit the space he created and get into good attacking positions from which they could shoot on goal this role has retroactively been likened by pundits to the modern false role and has also been compared to cruyffs own playing position cruyff did also use a genuine striker at times in particular when romrio joined the club defensively his teams made use of heavy pressing a high defensive line and the offside trap and relied on the positioning of his players to recover the ball quickly maintain possession and reduce the possibility of facing opposing counterattacks as such cruyffs philosophy was based on defending by attacking he also used sergi and ferrer as inverted fullbacks who moved inside to occupy central areas of the pitch flanking an offensive sweeper usually ronald koeman who could carry the ball start attacks or switch the play from the back while he also favoured goalkeepers who were comfortable with the ball at their feet and equally capable of building plays with their passing despite cruyffs reputation as one of the greatest managers of all time former milan and italy manager arrigo sacchi was critical of cruyff in however due to the fact that he did not pay as much attention to the defensive aspect of the game as he did to the offensive side winwithstyle philosophy winning is just one day a reputation can last a lifetime winning is an important thing but to have your own style to have people copy you to admire you that is the greatest giftcruyff always considered the aesthetic and moral aspects of the game it was not just about winning but about winning with the right style and in the right way he also always spoke highly of the entertainment value of the game the beautiful game for him was as much about entertainment and joy as results in the thinking of cruyff victory was only truly meaningful when it could fully capture the minds and hearts of competitors and spectators as he once noted quality without results is pointless results without quality is boring for cruyff choosing a right style of play to win was even more important than winning itself cruyff always believed in simplicity seeing simplicity and beauty as inseparable simple football is the most beautiful but playing simple football is the hardest thing as cruyff once summed up his fundamental philosophy how often do you see a pass of forty meters when twenty meters is enough to play well you need good players but a good player almost always has the problem of a lack of efficiency he always wants to do things prettier than strictly necessary cruyff also perfected a feint now known as the cruyff turn the feint is an example of the simplicity in cruyffs football philosophy it was neither carried out to embarrass the opponent nor to excite the watching crowd but because cruyff estimated that it was the simplest method in terms of effort and risk versus expected result to beat his opponent cruyff looked to pass or cross the ball then instead of kicking it he dragged the ball behind his planted foot with the inside of his other foot turned through degrees and accelerated away as swedish defender jan olsson a victim of the cruyff turn at the world cup recalled i played years in top football and seventeen times for sweden but that moment against cruyff was the proudest moment of my career i thought id win the ball for sure but he tricked me i was not humiliated i had no chance cruyff was a genius like dutch football in general until the mids cruyffs early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of british coaches such as vic buckingham the mindbody duality always played an important role in his footballing philosophy in cruyffs words quoted in dennis bergkamps autobiography stillness and speed my story because you play football with your head and your legs are there to help you if you dont use your head using your feet wont be sufficient why does a player have to chase the ball because he started running too late you have to pay attention use your brain and find the right position if you get to the ball late it means you chose the wrong position bergkamp was never late for cruyff football was an artisticoriented mindbody game instead of an athleticoriented physical competition as he put it every trainer talks about movement about running a lot i say dont run so much football is a game you play with your brain you have to be in the right place at the right moment not too early not too late the creativity was always the key element in his footballing philosophy both as a player and as a manager cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with louis van gaals more mechanized and rigid coaching style van gaal has a good vision on football but its not mine he wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics i dont i want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation i dont have anything against computers but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart on the basis of the criteria which are now in use at ajax recommended by van gaal i would have failed the test when i was i could barely kick the ball metres with my left and with the right maybe metres i would not have been able to take a corner besides i was physically weak and relatively slow my two qualities were great technique and insight which happen to be two things you can not measure with a computer cruyffs favourite world xi in his posthumously released autobiography my turn the autobiography cruyff reveals his dream alltime xi in his favourite formation cruyffs side in the diamond formation reads as follows lev yashin goalkeeper ruud krol full backwingback franz beckenbauer central defenderlibero carlos alberto fullbackwingback pep guardiola holding midfieldermidfield anchor bobby charlton alfredo di stfano diego maradona playmakerattacking midfieldersecond striker piet keizer winger garrincha winger and pel centreforwardstriker for humility cruyff did not put himself in there but there is a spot for his pupil pep guardiola and his former teammates ruud krol and piet keizer its a typically attacking lineup but cruyff explains the selection in detail for the ideal squad i also try and find a formula in which talent is used to the maximum in every case notes cruyff the qualities of one player have to complement the qualities of another cruyffs rules in his autobiography cruyff explained why he made a set of basic rules which are displayed at every cruyff court in the world i read an article once about the building of the pyramids in egypt it turns out that some of the numbers coincide completely with natural laws the position of the moon at certain times and so on and it makes you think how is it possible that those ancient people built something so scientifically complex they must have had something that we dont even though we always think that were a lot more advanced than they were take rembrandt and van gogh who can match them today when i think that way im increasingly convinced that everything is actually possible if they managed to do the impossible nearly five thousand years ago why cant we do it today that applies equally to football but also to something like the cruyff courts and school sports grounds my fourteen rules are set out for every court and every school sports ground to follow they are there to teach young people that sports and games can also be translated into everyday life and he listed his basic rules that include team player to accomplish things you have to do them together responsibility take care of things as if they were your own respect respect one another integration involve others in your activities initiative dare to try something new coaching always help each other within a team personality be yourself social involvement interaction is crucial both in sport and in life technique know the basics tactics know what to do development sport strengthens body and soul learning try to learn something new every day play together an essential part of any game creativity bring beauty to the sport named after cruyff cruyff turn known as

documentary film il profeta del gol cruyff said i like to drive for the km that separate the training camp from my house it relaxes me i love the cars business ventures in cruyff was reaching the twilight of his career in barcelona he began to imagine creating a range of footwear himself to challenge the technical and luxury qualities of those on the market beforehand after a few years of trying and failing to encourage big sportswear brands to take his idea seriously after all this was quite an unusual ambition of a professional sportsman at the time eventually he combined with his close friend italian designer emilio lazzarini and using his knowledge he set out to create a technical shoe which managed to balance functionality with elegance initially the range was filled with luxury indoor football shoes but they quickly became used as a fashion shoe due to their attractive appearance and so cruyff classics brand was born writing cruyff is the authorcoauthor of several books in dutch and spanish about his football career in particular his principles and view about the football world he also wrote his weekly columns for el peridico barcelonabased newspaper and de telegraaf amsterdambased newspaper cruyff was multilingual british football writer brian glanville wrote his intelligence off the field as well as on it was quite remarkable how well i remember seeing

and lost his father as a child this had a great influence on his future career and character he was renowned for his strong personality his character both in and beyond the footballing world was much described as the complicated combination of an idealist individualist libertarian collectivist romantic purist pragmatist rebel and even despot dutch sportswriter johan derksen a close friend of cruyff once said of him johan is absolutely religious though he never goes to church in august ajax players voted for piet keizer to be the teams captain in a secret ballot ahead of cruyff and cruyff decided his time in amsterdam had come to an end he joined barcelona just weeks later two years before the spanish dictator francisco franco died maintaining to the european press corps en route that he chose barcelona over rivals real madrid because he could never join a club associated with franco as he recalled in a documentary on tv channel i remember my move to spain was quite controversial the president of ajax wanted to sell me to real madrid barcelona werent at the same level as madrid football wise but it was a challenge to play for a catalan club barcelona was more than a club at the end of the season ajax decided not to offer cruyff a new contract this angered cruyff and he responded by signing for ajaxs archrivals feyenoord cruyffs season at feyenoord was a successful one in which the club won the eredivisie for the first time in a decade part of a league and knvb cup double cruyffs strong personality played a role in the struggle between puma and adidas the two rival brands that were born from the divisions between the two dassler brothers cruyff was a fan of pumas king boots and by had signed a sponsorship deal with the german sportswear and equipment supplier at the world cup he was under contract with puma in a deal that prohibited him from promoting other sports brands as the tournament approached cruyff flatly refused to wear adidass trademark three black stripes on his no jersey the netherlands national football association had little choice but to honour the wishes of their best player and dutch officials eventually persuaded adidas to design a separate jersey just for cruyff with just two stripes running along the sleeves jersey number until the s players did not have fixed numberingexcept in some short competitions like the world cup or european championship where players were given a designated number the starting players usually wore jerseys from to and the substitutes from to cruyffs usual number was on october cruyff was coming back from a longterm injury to play ajaxs rivals psv however in the locker room before the match teammate gerrie muhren could not find his number jersey cruyff offered his shirt to muhren and went to the basket to pick another one at random it happened to be the number ajax won and cruyff suggested they keep the same numbers to the following gameaccording to muhren in an interview to voetbal international it was a form to challenge the dutch football association from then on cruyff kept using the number for ajax and netherlands national team when he was allowed to in the fifa world cup netherlands head coach rinus michels wanted his squad to wear numbers alphabetically as cruyff was the first player on the roster he would be number but he refused and insisted on wearing his lucky number forward ruud geels ended up with the number shirt while goalkeeper jan jongbloed played as the number although the number had become a trademark for cruyff he could be seen wearing his old number on other occasions like during most of his career for fc barcelona because the league demanded starting players were numbered to or for netherlands in the european championship in ajax retired cruyffs number relations with others cruyff remained a controversial figure throughout his life his relationships with ajax bara and knvb royal dutch football association were turbulent for some time especially in his later years in his native netherlands there was always a lovehate relationship between cruyff and his fellow countrymen a dispute with goalkeeper jan van beveren resulted in van beveren being dropped from the dutch national side after cruyff refused to play if he was picked there was a longstanding feud between cruyff and louis van gaal though never confirmed publicly by both sides he also often criticised jos mourinho for his defensivebased coaching philosophy stated jos mourinho is a negative coach he only cares about the result and does not care much for good football as david winner notes cruyff has had many enemies and critics over the years he has been accused of being arrogant greedy intolerant despotic too idealistic too stubborn insufficiently interested in defending and simply too difficult a personality he loves an argument and his conflictmodel method of working can be bruising and winner concludes that with his belief in the conflict model the idea that you got the best out of people by provoking fights and thereby raising levels of excitement and adrenaline cruyff made enemies almost as easily as he generated delight battles with club presidents and teammates led to ruptures especially at ajax and barcelona the two clubs that defined his career criticism cruyff was also well known for his vocal criticism and uncompromising attitude a perfectionist he always had a strong opinion about things and was loyal to his principles even more than anything else in the football world as an outspoken and critical visionary he strongly criticized the netherlands style of play at the world cup who am i supporting i am dutch but i support the football that spain is playing spains style is the style of barcelona spain a replica of bara is the best publicity for football cruyff wrote in his weekly column for the barcelonabased newspaper el peridico prior to the final match until the early s barcelona had mounting debts built up over the previous few seasons a situation that forced the club to push through an emergency bailout loan of million the qatar foundation run by sheikha mozah became the first shirt sponsor in barcelonas year history the club had previously used unicefs logo on the front of its shirts in incoming barcelona president sandro rosell agreed the deal for a period of five seasons with the club receiving million each year starting on july and running until june plus bonuses for trophies won that could total m writing in his el peridico column cruyff slammed the deal we are a unique club in the world no one has kept their jersey intact throughout their history yet have remained as competitive as they come we have sold this uniqueness for about six percent of our budget i understand that we are currently losing more than we are earning however by selling the shirt it shows me that we are not being creative and that we have become vulgar in an interview with the guardians donald mcrae in cruyff spoke about footballs lost values and how money had eroded the games purity football is now all about money there are problems with the values within the game this is sad because football is the most beautiful game we can play it in the street we can play it everywhere everyone can play it whether youre tall or small fat or thin but those values are being lost we have to bring them back personal life at the wedding of ajax teammate piet keizer on june cruyff met his future wife diana margaretha danny coster born they started dating and on december at the age of he married danny her father was dutch businessman cor coster who also happened to be cruyffs agent he was also credited with engineering cruyffs move to fc barcelona in the marriage is said to have been happy for almost years contrary to his wellknown strong personality and superstar status cruyff led a relatively quiet private life beyond the world of football a highly principled strongminded and devoted family man cruyffs football career both as a player and as a manager was considerably influenced by his family in particular his wife danny he and danny had three children together chantal november susila january and jordi february the family lived in barcelona from with a sixyear interruption from december to january when they lived in vinkeveen in cruyff announced his decision to retire from international football at the age of despite still being lean and wiry after helping the country qualify for the world cup this move shrouded in mystery and met with disbelief back in late was only finally stripped of its mystique in when cruyff explained his decision in an interview with catalunya rdio it was while still living in barcelona as a player in late cruyff and his family became the victims of an armed attacker who forced his way into his flat in barcelona the man who was then the ultimate football superstar was confronted with the choice between family values and a highly promising world cup glory at the end of his international career in the interview with catalunya rdio he said that the attempted kidnap was the reason he decided not to go to the world cup in argentina in as he recalled you should know that i had problems at the end of my career as a player here and i dont know if you know that someone put a rifle at my head and tied me up and tied up my wife in front of the children at our flat in barcelona the children were going to school accompanied by the police the police slept in our house for three or four months i was going to matches with a bodyguard all these things change your point of view towards many things there are moments in life in which there are other values we wanted to stop this and be a little more sensible it was the moment to leave football and i couldnt play in the world cup after this cruyff named his third child after the patron saint of catalonia st jordi commonly known in english as saint george of lydda this was seen as a provocative gesture towards the then spanish dictator general franco who had made all symbols of catalan nationalism illegal cruyff had to fly his son back to the netherlands to register his birth as the name jordi had been banned by the spanish authorities cruyffs decision to go to such great lengths to support catalan nationalism is part of the reason he is a hero to barcelona supporters and catalan nationalists jordi cruyff played for teams such as barcelona while father johan was manager manchester united alavs and espanyol he wore jordi on his shirt to distinguish himself from his father which also reflects the common spanish practice of referring to players by given names alone or by nicknames his grandson jesjua angoy played for dayton dutch lions

child he attended sunday school where he was taught about the bible and that while he did not go to church as an adult he believed theres something there the dutch evangelical broadcaster eo posted an interview conducted before cruyffs death with his friend johan derksen the editorinchief of voetbal international magazine people dont know the real johan cruyff derksen said i have on occasion had beautiful conversations with him about faith because we both went to the same kind of schools and learned about the bible and it stays with you cruyff also expressed his faith in god in an interview with hanneke groenteman on sterren op het doek quotes every trainer talks about movement about running a lot i say dont run so much football is a game you play with your brain you have to be in the right place at the right moment not too early not too late in my teams the goalie is the first attacker and the striker the first defender every disadvantage has its advantage if you cant win make sure you dont lose quality without results is pointless results without quality is boring winning is an important thing but to have your own style to have people copy you to admire you that is the greatest gift playing football is very simple but playing simple football is the hardest thing there is illness death and tributes cruyff had always been a heavy smoker from his boyhood until he

and derby progress to the final against aston villa with bielsa denying the narrative of bielsa burnout journalists theory that his sides tire in the second half of a season bielsa said one of the big reasons leeds failed to gain promotion was their profligacy in front of goal saying that statistically leeds needed more chances to score compared to their league rivals promotion to the premier league on may bielsa and leeds jointly exercised the option on bielsas contract to continue as leeds head coach for the following season after bielsa had signed his new contract leeds announced the

streak of argentina supremacy with the last defeat coming from the qualifiers on october it also ended the match streak without defeats in qualifiers the last one coming from bolivia in and it was the first defeat of argentina as world champions with the last match loss against saudi arabia at the group stage the icing on the cake was the fact that this was the firstever uruguay victory over argentina as homeaway for qualifiers days later they secured another home victory of against bolivia with nez scoring a brace to end coaching style hailed as one of the most influential coaches of all time introducing a third wave ideology in argentine coaching previously influenced by csar luis menotti and carlos bilardo pep guardiola has described bielsa as the best in the world he has been a strong influence on his former players many of whom later became coaches including mauricio pochettino diego simeone and marcelo gallardo bielsas signature formation in his squads is the formation which he became known for during his coaching tenures with the argentina and chile national teams and with marseille although the and its variations the and the diamond were occasionally used by other managers at uefa champions league and fifa world cup level before bielsa including by johan cruyff at barcelona by louis van gaal at ajax by guus hiddink at psv eindhoven and australia by vicente del bosque at real madrid by ottmar hitzfeld at bayern munich by frank pagelsdorf at hamburger sv by ivica osim at sturm graz and by russia it was bielsa who first made it his standard formation and popularized it worldwide during his tenures with argentina chile at olympique de marseille and occasionally at athletic de bilbao for this formation the players are three defenders three midfielders one central midfielder with two wide players wing backs three attacking midfielders one no and two wingers and one centreforward the allows quick transitions from defending to attacking as many of the players used in the formation can perform both defensive and attacking tasks moreover it establishes superiority in numbers in every part of the field since with this formation his teams could defend with seven players attack with six or seven players or protect a scoreline by overwhelming the midfield with six players to use all players have to quickly set to attacking positions when the ball is in the teams possession and all players have to aggressively press and recover the ball when it is not in possession so it requires great teamwork and understanding between teammates when he took the argentina job at the end of his first training session bielsa handed the players a pencil and a little slip of paper he wanted them to write down whether they wanted to line up with a back three or a four he went through all the replies back four back four back four this clearly shows your preference for a line of four but im telling you that from now on were going to be playing with a back three see you tomorrow and he won them over bringing them round to his way of thinking he adapted to an attacking at athletic bilbao as seen in the uefa europa league final with fullbacks pushing forward and a converted midfielder in the back line also involved in buildup play with the pressing and coordination elements still in evidence in the season at leeds united bielsa introduced a formation with kalvin phillips converted from a boxtobox or attacking midfielder into the deeplying midfielder when facing a team who played with two central strikers bielsa would switch to the with phillips dropping further back into the defensive line as a centreback or sweeper or luke ayling shifting from right back this signature style of bielsas has had so much influence in the football scene that many present coaches former players under bielsas command are heavily influenced by the style such as gerardo martino mauricio pochettino diego simeone matas almeyda eduardo berizzo mauricio pellegrino santiago solari andrea pisanu and marcelo gallardo current manchester city manager pep guardiola credited bielsa as his tactical inspiration and called him the best manager in the world in jorge sampaoli former manager of argentina sevilla fc and chile has been described as a disciple of bielsa former argentina national team captain roberto ayala a defender under bielsa stated sometimes we wouldnt see any of the strikers because hed have them training at a different time and it was the same with the midfielders bielsa is known for watching and collecting numerous football videos to the point of obsession he edits and analyses each video for each individual player he also uses statistical software and other technological tools to prepare for games john carlin an english journalist has stated that bielsa has the most learned football library on the planet bielsa likes to systematise the game he says that there are distinct formations in football and believes that every young player should be given the opportunity to experience each of them discovered by bielsa prolific former argentina national team striker gabriel batistuta proclaimed bielsa to be the one who taught me how to train on rainy days he taught me everything fernando llorente who played under bielsa at athletic bilbao said of his former coach at first he seems tough and he may even annoy you with his persistence and donttakenoforananswer resilience but in the end he is a genius chile international alexis snchez said of bielsa i learned a lot from him and it is because of him that i am who i am bayern munich player javi martnez who worked with bielsa at bilbao said that bielsa taught me a lot how to play as a centreback and to learn a different style of football everyone should work with him at least once in their life bielsa is credited with the rise of the leeds united and england international player kalvin phillips with former leeds united manager howard wilkinson stating bielsa can take huge credit for the player that phillips has developed into manchester city and france player benjamin mendy noted for his improvement under bielsa at marseille said bielsa had given back to him the strength and aggressiveness lost last year his club and international teammate aymeric laporte who was given his debut by bielsa at athletic bilbao described him as a mentor figure while fellow france international dimitri payet who worked with bielsa at marseille said the season with marcelo bielsa made me grow as a man and especially on the field in the game he gave me important bases that i still use today former lille player nicolas pp now at arsenal who was signed by bielsa for lille described bielsa as special and a great coach bielsas unique style continued at leeds where to receive a work permit from the uk government he had to prove exceptional talent he did so by compiling a dossier of every formation used in every championship match during the season with notes on frequency and variations once at the yorkshire club he instituted allday training sessions gave the first team their own private space at thorp arch and had sleeping quarters installed in his office so he could devote more time to match analysis as a motivational tactic bielsa once made players pick up litter around the training ground for three hours as he had been told that was how long an average leeds fan worked to afford a ticket some critics have argued that the taxing demands of bielsas management style have led to his teams starting a season brightly before a dip in performances as players begin to tire in august bielsa was one of the main stars of leeds united documentary take us home documenting the season on amazon prime featuring in several episodes in voiceover before doing an interview for the final episode the end the documentary was narrated by actor and leeds united fan russell crowe after leeds defeat of thenchasing rivals west bromwich albion at home on march in take us home bielsa through a translator mused on the nature of victory i came to be part of a programme that has goals and of course we are aware of the goals wanted by the city and the club the players the fans everybody but i also cant say that my only interest is winning what also interests me is the way we build to the victory managerial statistics as of match played

golden boots a minute special episode of the british animated series peppa pig total football dutch totaalvoetbal is a tactical system in association football in which any outfield player can take over the role of any other player in a team a player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team thus retaining the teams intended organisational structure in this fluid system no outfield player is fixed in a predetermined role anyone can successively play as an attacker a midfielder and a defender the only player who must stay in a specified position is the goalkeeper total footballs tactical success depends largely on the adaptability of each footballer within the team in particular the ability to quickly switch positions depending on the onfield situation the theory requires players to be comfortable in multiple positions hence it requires intelligent and technically diverse players manager rinus michels is generally credited with introducing this system during the s at dutch club ajax and the netherlands national football team however some authors credit teams such as the austrian wunderteam of the s or the golden team of hungary of the s for having played in a similar style to total football both sides were influenced by jimmy hogan who was in turn influenced by the combination game history pres the first foundations for what became known as total football were laid by jimmy hogan a burnley native who was influenced by the scottish combination game working with austrian coach and his friend hugo meisl in the early s meisls austria national football team known as the wunderteam became possibly the first side to play total football hogans influence reached beyond the austrian borders as two decades later the hungary national team also known as the golden team played a similar style of football under coach gusztv sebes the then president of the hungarian football association sandor barcs said jimmy hogan taught us everything we know about football torino grande torino as the team was called in the s played a similar style as the austrians between and argentinian club river plate formed a remarkable team known as la mquina the machine whose attack formed by carlos muoz jos manuel moreno adolfo pedernera ngel labruna and flix loustau perfected the false nine style and the constant change of attack positions la mquina won several argentine and international titles also in the s english manager jack reynolds implemented a style that was bearing similarities to total football at ajax leading the dutch club to rise in importance and win trophies for the first time in the late s and early s burnley were playing a renewed system in english football where every player could play in every position under manager harry potts this total football system led the club to the first division title and won many plaudits including admiration from alltime english first division top scorer jimmy greaves another pioneer was vic buckingham manager of west bromwich albion ajax and barcelona in the s and s as the footballing education that he established helped the progressive nature of the type of football of rinus michels and later johan cruyff a player who was introduced into the ajax first team by vic buckingham totaalvoetbal schools rinus michels who played under reynolds later became manager of ajax in michels developed the tactics of total football after most importantly with the introduction of forward johan cruyff perhaps the systems most famous exponent although cruyff was fielded as centre forward michels encouraged cruyff to roam freely around the pitch using technical ability and intelligence to exploit the weaknesses in the opposition and create chances cruyffs teammates also worked to adapt themselves accordingly regularly switching positions to ensure tactical roles in the team were consistently filled austrian coach ernst happel reworked the theory to introduce strength encouraging his players to play tougher during his spells at ado den haag and feyenoord happel also managed the netherlands national team to a runnerup finish in the fifa world cup the major component was the use of space with the need to consistently create space central to the concept of total football former ajax defender barry hulshoff described it as the thing we discussed the whole time cruyff always talked about where to run and where to stand and when not to move he further elaborated that position switching was only made possible due to apt spatial awareness he also described total football being proactive as well as highlighting the use of pressing which would be used to win back the ball or put the opposition under considerable pressure michels and cruyff saw unprecedented success with the system winning eight eredivisie titles three european cups and one intercontinental cup the stark rise of total football and its attacking prowess was also linked with the death of catenaccio an italian system reliant heavily on defence promoted by helenio herreras internazionale during the s the total football system was prone to defeat experienced notably in the final of the fifa world cup contested by the dutch and west germany michels and cruyff saw their ability to introduce playmaking stifled in the second half of the match by the effective marking of berti vogts this allowed franz beckenbauer uli hoene and wolfgang overath to gain a stronghold in midfield thus enabling west germany to win modern era building further on the foundations of total football a new tactical system developed in fc barcelona particularly under manager pep guardiola and the spain national team during the late s and early s this came to be known as juego de posicin or tikitaka see also antifootball association football tactics and skills formation association football references tikitaka spanish tikitaka is a style of play in football characterised by short passing and movement working the ball through various channels and maintaining possession the style is primarily associated with the spain national team since by the managers luis aragons and vicente del bosque tikitaka methods were eventually embraced by the la liga club barcelona from especially during the era of manager pep guardiola however guardiola distanced himself and the club from the style i loathe all that passing for the sake of it stating bara didnt do tikitaka adding you have to pass the ball with a clear intention with the aim of making it into the oppositions goal its development and influence goes back to johan cruyffs tenure as manager in the early s all the way to the present the first goal using this system is considered to be the sergio ramos goal in the qualifying match for uefa euro played in aarhus denmark on october the play involved players making passes with touches over seconds spain went on to win the competition predecessors earlier tactics that like tikitaka rose to success in their times due to an unprecedented perfection in passing and movement without the ball include the schalker kreisel schalke spinning top which won schalke six german championships between and and the total football used by ajax and the dutch national team during the s manager angelo niculescu adopted a style that is also considered a precursor of tikitaka the romanian term was temporizare which translates to delaying the team would try to keep possession of the ball for as long as possible using repeated and short passes until a breach in the opposition defense was found using this tactic he transformed the romanian national team and managed to qualify them to the mexico world cup after a year absence origins and development etymology the late spanish broadcaster andrs montes is generally credited with coining and popularizing the phrase tikitaka during his television commentary on lasexta for the world cup although the term was already in colloquial use in spains football and may have originated as a critical or derogatory term by then athletic bilbao coach javier clemente in his live commentary of the spain versus tunisia match montes used the phrase to describe spains precise elegant passing style estamos tocando tikitaka tikitaka we are playing tikitaka tikitaka barcelona the roots of what would develop into tikitaka began to be implemented by johan cruyff during his tenure as manager of barcelona from to the style of play continued to develop under fellow dutch managers louis van gaal and frank rijkaard and has been adopted by other la liga teams barcelonas dutch managers made it a point to promote from their youth system and barcelonas la masia youth academy has been credited with producing a generation of technically talented often physically small players such as pedro xavi andrs iniesta cesc fbregas and lionel messi players with excellent touch vision and passing who excel at maintaining possession pep guardiola managed barcelona from to winning titles under his guidance tikitaka was established this was partly due to guardiolas visionary coaching partly due to an exceptional generation of players many of whom had been schooled in la masias idiosyncratic style and partly due to barcelonas ability to sustain intense pressure on the ball the update to the offside law was also a contributing factor by forcing defenders deeper the law expanded the effective playing area making players size matter less and allowing technical skills to flourish the tactic shared dutch total footballs principle of high defensive line positional interchange and use of possession to control the game tikitaka diverged from its total football roots by subordinating everything to the pass guardiola played a centerforward as a false nine to keep the ball moving fluidly from different angles he played the fullbacks higher he selected midfielders in defense to exploit their passing ability and he forced the goalkeeper to play the ball out from the back the guiding principle of this type of play was the efficient use of space the teams must narrow the playing space while defending and must expand the playing space wider while attacking the objective was to make quick and short passes till an opponent was caught out of position and space was created pep also used the concept of positional play which in simple words means that the pitch is divided into different zones and that no more than two players must occupy the same line vertically no more than three players should occupy the same line horizontally guardiola trained his players by painting lines on the training ground to show players what the zones were this training made it an instinct of the players to find zones where they could receive or play a pass thus for a layman it would have looked like passing and keeping possession it was quite calculated spain national team raphael honigstein describes the tikitaka played by the spain national team at the world cup as a radical style that only evolved over the course of four years arising from spains decision in that they werent physical and tough enough to outmuscle opponents so instead wanted to concentrate on monopolising the ball luis aragons and vicente del bosque successfully employed the tikitaka style with the spain national team during their tenure spain won three consecutive major titles euro under aragons the fifa world cup and euro under del bosque tactical overview tikitaka is founded upon team unity and a comprehensive understanding in the geometry of space on a football field pep guardiolas example of tikitaka at barcelona is considered the best application of this style after they won the sextuple in barcelona played with a high defensive line usually applying the offside trap with midfielders providing support to defenders to make more passing options available defenders are patient preferring safe pass options looking for midfielders with the ball circulated anywhere on the pitch waiting for a gap to make a vertical pass the team created most of chances depending on through balls and performing give and go pass usually with lionel messi involved in action guardiola preferred freedom in the final third of the pitch which was effective as the team created many chances per match tikitaka has been variously described as a style of play based on making your way to the back of the net through short passing and movement a short passing style in which the ball is worked carefully through various channels and a nonsensical phrase that has come to mean short passing patience and possession above all else the style involves roaming movement and positional interchange among midfielders moving the ball in intricate patterns and sharp one or twotouch passing tikitaka is both defensive and offensive in equal measure the team is always in possession so does not need to switch between defending and attacking commentators have contrasted tikitaka with route one physicality and with the highertempo passing of arsne wengers arsenal side which employed cesc fbregas as the only channel between defence and attack tikitaka is associated with flair creativity and touch but can also be taken to a slow directionless extreme that sacrifices effectiveness for aesthetics notable success tikitaka has been used successfully by the spain national team first under luis aragons to win euro and subsequently under vicente del bosque to win the world cup and euro it was also used to great success by barcelona under pep guardiola between and his team won six trophies in including a continental treble of la liga the copa del rey and the uefa champions league followed by the uefa super cup the spain super cup and the fifa club world cup the teams attacking possessionbased tikitaka tactics and formation also allowed them to win two more consecutive la liga titles as well as the uefa champions league among other trophies while luis enrique adopted a faster and more direct tactical approach during his tenure as barcelonas manager he also used some similar aspects of tikitaka such as an exciting attackingminded possessionbased passing game and building plays from the back on the ground while instead successfully modifying other elements of his teams gameplay and abandoning the use of long balls that had characterised tata martinos spell with the team he led barcelona to a second continental treble during the season capturing la liga the copa del rey and the uefa champions league sid lowe identifies luis aragons tempering of tikitaka with pragmatism as a key factor in spains success in euro aragons used tikitaka to protect a defense that appeared suspect maintain possession and dominate games without taking the style to evangelical extremes none of spains first six goals in the tournament came from tikitaka five came from direct breaks and one from a set play for lowe spains success in the world cup was evidence of the meeting of two traditions in spains football the powerful aggressive direct style that earned the silver medalwinning antwerp olympics team the nickname la furia roja the red fury and the tikitaka style of the contemporary spain team which focused on a collective shortpassing technical and possessionbased game analyzing spains semifinal victory over germany at the world cup honigstein described the teams tikitaka style as the most difficult version of football possible an uncompromising passing game coupled with intense high pressing for honigstein tikitaka is a significant upgrade of total football because it relies on ball movement rather than players switching position tikitaka allowed spain to control both the ball and the opponent at the womens world cup the japan womens national football team nadeshiko employed a form of tikitaka under coach norio sasaki they upset hosts germany and the united states to win the tournament criticism while the tikitaka style has been praised by several pundits and footballing figures due to its success and attacking approach it has also been criticised at times during euro for example the spain national side drew criticism in the media for adopting a strikerless formation and a dull brand of tikitaka which produced relatively few goals despite the team dominating possession throughout the tournament with spain averaging ball possession during their three group matches in the leadup to their final victory spain averaged passes per shot and only goals per match which was lower than the tournament average of journalist guy hedgecoe from iberosphere argued that tikitaka is not entertaining any more due to the lack of pure strikers in the spain national team and their use of a false or a midfield player as a forward this makes the game of football full of midfielders and no strikers or defenders hedgecoe claimed with no strikers no defendersno goalkeeper perhaps just technically blessed midfielders merrily passing the ball around until someone walks it into the net jos mourinho has criticised the spain national team for using sterile techniques such as having no strikers and only midfielders former arsenal manager arsne wenger had said that the spain football team had changed their philosophy becoming less attacking and more negative saying originally they wanted possession in order to attack and win the game now it seems to be first and foremost a way not to lose during euro a competition spain had won others believed that the lack of emphasis on the offensive led to fewer goals and that the teams seemingly endless passing was in fact boring with rob smyth of the guardian dubbing it tikitakanaccio a reference to the defensiveminded catenaccio tactical system in a interview with la gazzetta dello sport spain and barcelona defender gerard piqu admitted that he felt that barcelona had become predictable in the way they played as a result of being overly dependent on tikitaka stating we played the last few years with homegrown coaches first pep and then tito and maybe we ended up exasperating our style of play to the extent that we found ourselves slaves to that system that style now that tata who comes from outside the club has arrived and who shares the same ideas of football which are based on possession he is however showing us different options its very positive because it gives us variety when we are being pressed sending the ball long a few times is not negative it helps you mix things up giving you oxygen and preventing us from getting crushed with no way out we have started pressing far up the field again winning back possession in the final third of the field and from there its far easier to create chances without having to build up from right at the back particularly against sides who close up a lot its normal to try to develop new ideas and variations after many years our opponents obviously knew how we attacked how we moved look at alves and alba for example they push a lot and some opponents would give them space down the wing but not let them move inside it became difficult to get in we needed to find alternative solutions and tatas doing that without ruining our style we still have the same possession we needed variations like this although pep guardiola is known for adopting a tikitaka inspired playing style with his teams in he was dismissive of the use of the particular label being applied to describe his teams playing styles moreover he himself was critical of a possessionbased strategy with little attacking intent stating i loathe all that passing for the sake of it all that tikitaka its so much rubbish and has no purpose you have to pass the ball with a clear intention with the aim of making it into the oppositions goal its not about passing for the sake of it dont believe what people say bara didnt do tikitaka its completely made up dont believe a word of it in all team sports the secret is to overload one side of the pitch so that the opponent must tilt its own defence to cope you overload on one side and draw them in so that they leave the other side weak in italian defender giorgio chiellini expressed his belief that the popularisation of the attackingminded tikitaka playing style associated with the spain national side and barcelona under guardiola and the increasing focus on developing defenders who are comfortable with the ball at their feet from a young age had in fact had a negative impact on their overall defensive quality and italian footballs ability to produce top defenders in particular stating guardiolismo a term he coined for the guardiola way has ruined a generation of italian defenders a bit now everyone is looking to push up defenders know how to set the tone of play and they can spread the ball but they dont know how to mark unfortunately thats the way it is when i was young we used to do drills to get a feel for the man you were marking nowadays from crosses italian defenders and i can only really talk for italian defenders i am only relatively interested about foreign players dont mark their man its a great pity because were losing our dna a bit and some of those characteristics which had made us excel in the world now we need talented players up front but we also need to bring somebody through in defence because we are never going to be able to play spains tikitaka because its not part of our philosophy similarly in italian goalkeeper gianluigi buffon expressed mixed views regarding goalkeepers being given more responsibilities with the ball at their feet as well as the fact that keepers were being increasingly judged by scouts more on their ball skills than their goalkeeping ability stating today there is this great in my opinion exaggerated focus on how keepers play the ball with their feet how they need to pass and move with their other teammates i myself ever since i was a kid was an atypical goalkeeper i often had this role of being a libero playing with my feet a lot at times honestly i did it in an excessive way despite that i maintain one thing if you lose that true attention that sincere focus on being a good goalkeeper which means stopping shots knowing how to come out for a high ball understanding how you approach a low ball as you come off your line then for me youre being asked to totally go against your natural role he also added you see goalkeepers today who are much better than their peers but wind up getting overlooked in favour of someone else who can play three tidy passes if you ask me i would say that every great team or at least the teams that have won has always had a great keeper who knows how to make saves first of all after that if they can do things with their feet then sure that is even better history of countering tikitaka the highprofile success of tikitaka as practiced by barcelona and the spain national team in the late s led to a variety of tactics and formations designed to contain and counter the systems domination of ball possession season guardiolas barcelona faced different teams and managed wins against all of them except chelsea during the champions league semifinals chelsea who were managed by guus hiddink used a solid compact and communicating defence to force bara to shoot outside the penalty area as well as having defender jos bosingwa helped by centreback john terry and defensive midfielder michael essien manmark lionel messi this worked as the first leg was a draw at the camp nou the draw ensured chelsea were the first visiting team that season to keep a clean sheet in baras home stadium in a controversial second leg match with chelsea calling for up to four penalties chelsea were up until andrs iniesta scored in stoppage time to level the tie at and let bara advance on away goals fifa confederations cup the first team to defeat the spain national team in a tournament during the tikitaka era was the united states who eliminated spain with a victory in the semifinals of the fifa confederations cup usa coach bob bradley used a narrow and deep designed to force spains possession to wide areas and draw spains defence out of shape creating space for counterattacks that resulted in goals for jozy altidore and clint dempsey season in the semifinals of the champions league jos mourinhos internazionale players denied bara space as they doublemarked messi and prevented xavi from achieving a successful passing rhythm inter won the first leg and then lost to advance on aggregate mourinho would become manager of real madrid the next season and employ similar tactics resulting in a bitter domestic rivalry with guardiola over the following two years fifa world cup in their opening game of the world cup spain suffered a loss to switzerland following the match switzerlands manager ottmar hitzfeld admitted that he had been influenced by united states coach bob bradleys tactics from the confederations cups match between the usa and spain season chelsea manager roberto di matteo succeeded in countering tikitaka when his team met bara in the semifinals of the uefa champions league according to chelseas fernando torres concentrating on space rather than trying to steal the ball was part of his squads strategy to counter bara winning battles on the wings such as ramires against dani alves would force bara to funnel their attacks toward the centre of the field former chelsea winger pat nevin noted that stationing three disciplined midfielders in front of the back four defenders denied bara space forcing lionel messi to withdraw deeper and narrower to get to the ball as messi was high on the pitch he was stripped of the ball by chelseas frank lampard which led to a goal for chelsea in the first leg during the second leg di matteo deployed a formation with a very compact midfield structure while bara enjoyed of ball possession over the two legs and shots to chelseas of these shots on target versus chelseas four by contrast chelseas frank lampard completed two telling passes in the two legs both of them leading to goals it has been suggested that baras weakness offensively is winning balls in the air especially against a team like chelsea that has the size and strength to control balls in the box chelsea achieved a victory in the first leg and a tie in the second to overcome bara season the next season barcelona faced massimiliano allegris ac milan in the champions league round of in the first leg at the san siro milan employed a very narrow formation with stephan el shaarawy acting both as a second striker and a fifth midfielder ready to break in behind dani alves and sulley muntari closely manmarking xavi in the center thus barcelona had only one chance on goal and ended up losing in the second leg barca changed their formation to what was effectively a with david villa in a centreforward role allowing messi space between the lines and completely demolishing milans shape ending in a barcelona victory later in the same season tikitakas vulnerability was exposed when bayern munich defeated bara in the champions league semifinals and in the return leg bayern head coach jupp heynckes had built upon his predecessor louis van gaals foundations by making the team more defensively balanced while replacing van gaals positional footballeveryone had to stick to their specific space on the pitch when attacking the opposition goalwith a much more fluid and attacking style that gave the forwards freedom to roam and swap in the first leg bara enjoyed possession but bayern had corners to barcelonas four and had nine shots on goal to baras one bayerns bastian schweinsteiger and javi martnez held a compact midfield that played crucial roles in shutting down barcelonas xavis and andrs iniestas attempts to pass forward at midfield while arjen robben and franck ribry proved effective on the wings bayerns firsthalf tactics involved fake pressing pushing close to their markers in possession to drive bara away from danger areas with sheer presence while conserving their energy by not committing themselves keeping bayerns players fresh enough for the second half to mount attacks though they had managed to outscore lesser opponents barcelonas defense was vulnerable as the absence of centerbacks carles puyol and javier mascherano robbed the team of physical presence to guard against set pieces which bayern exploited the guardian proclaimed that some suggested bayern would attempt to outplay barcelona at short passing football but ultimately it was a perfect recipe of barcelonas traditional problems set pieces counterattacks and physicality that will lead many to suggest the balance of power has shifted from catalonia to bavaria fifa confederations cup tikitaka was again exposed when brazil defeated spain in the confederations cup final ending spains run of unbeaten matches in competitive football the ball possession was for brazil and for spain with two goals conceded in the first half of the match season diego simeones atltico madrid faced barcelona six times in the season managing to remain undefeated in all six matches simeone utilized a formation with gabi and tiago as the defensive midfielders koke and arda turan acting more like insidemidfielders than traditional wingers raul garca or david villa often dropping deep to join the midfield and diego costa as the lone striker upfront in this formation simeone denied barcelona their vital space in the midfield rendering tikitaka tactics useless against atltico atltico also relied on their height advantage over the bara players with centrebacks diego godn and miranda intercepting all barcelona longballs and often going forward when atltico took a corner kick or freekick it is no coincidence that godn scored atlticos goal in the last league match against barcelona a header from a cornerkick to give simeones team the league title atltico also managed to eliminate barcelona from the champions league relying on these tactics carlo ancelottis real madrid relied on positioning to force pep guardiolas bayern munich to defeat in the first semifinal leg of the uefa champions league at the santiago bernabu bayern practicing a form of tikitaka pressed high in attack but was vulnerable in defence real madrids players strictly kept their positions when defending and managed to score on a counterattack winning the first game in the second leg in munich bayerns defences were even more vulnerable and real madrid managed a resounding victory their first ever away victory against bayern eliminating the champions league holders fifa world cup in the world cup dutch manager louis van gaal deployed a formation against spain in the first match of the group stage this formation had robin van persie and arjen robben as strikers a threeman midfield assisted by wingbacks daryl janmaat and daley blind and a threeman defence spain managed to open the score from a controversial penalty won by diego costa and converted by xabi alonso but the swift counterattacks of the netherlands proved highly effective in the rest of the match resulting in a victory for the dutch topped off by robin van persies flying dutchman masterpiece the worst defeat for spain in years it is noteworthy that van gaal was the manager of barcelona in the season the man mainly responsible for bringing up xavi and andrs iniesta who went on to become basic elements of barcelona and spains tikitaka style in the second match of the group stage chile under jorge sampaoli used a fluidlychanging formation evolving into a when defending and having their three central midfielders manmark spains three central midfielders marcelo daz on david silva charles arnguiz on xabi alonso and arturo vidal on sergio busquets a tactic previously used by influential coach marcelo bielsa chile managed to score twice in the first half and spain were unable to breach their opponents fiveman defence exiting the world cup in the group stage spains disastrous world cup along with barcelonas move to a more direct style under managers gerardo martino and luis enrique have marked the end of tikitaka uefa euro following a successful qualifying campaign a rejuvenated spain entered uefa euro with a majority of the teams golden generation still intact along with a new wave of attacking players such as nolito and lvaro morata leading the line la rojas opening two group games against the czech republic and turkey both resulted in convincing and wins respectively with the new generation of attacking talent combining with the tikitaka style of play of the remaining players from the golden generation spain quickly became unanimous favourites for the tournament by the media and with two wins from their first two group games spain look set to win their group giving them the luxury of not having to play a group winner until the semifinal round going into their final group game against secondplaced croatia thanks to the croatians effective exploitation of spains vulnerability to the counterattack spain lost their final group game despite having taken an early lead through alvaro morata which was canceled out by a goal later in the half from nikola kalini followed by a lastgasp winner from ivan perii as a result spain finished runnersup in their group behind croatia setting them up for a rematch of their euro final with italy despite being the favourites spain were caught off guard by italys uncharacteristically aggressive attacking play in the first half as italy took the lead just after the halfhour mark with giorgio chiellini putting away a rebound from an italian freekick spain began to regain more ball possession and began to push for an equalizer in the second half but the italians strong defense repeatedly repelled spains attack spain also lacked enough space in the midfield to create any decent chances due to italian coach antonio contes usage of a formation with italys superior numbers in the midfield allowing italy to create multiple scoring opportunities on the counterattack that was previously exploited by croatia italy ultimately scored another goal in added time through graziano pell securing the win for italy see also golden team total football football tactics and skills formation spain national football team barcelona football skills barcelona dream team lionel messi references catenaccio italian pronunciation katenatto or the chain is a tactical system in football with a strong emphasis on defence in italian catenaccio means doorbolt which implies a highly organised and effective backline defence focused on nullifying opponents attacks and preventing goalscoring opportunities history predecessors and influences italian catenaccio was influenced by the verrou also doorbolt or chain in french system invented by austrian coach karl rappan as coach of switzerland in the s and s rappan played a defensive sweeper called the verrouilleur positioned just ahead of the goalkeeper rappans verrou system proposed in when he was coach of servette was essentially a modification of the system and in some ways resembled the modern or formations his system implemented with four defenders three of which were fielded in a fixed role playing a strict mantoman marking system plus an attacking centrehalf who would also act as a playmaker in the middle of the field who played the ball together with two midfield wings the system was essentially a formation with the verouiller as the last player in front of the goalkeeper and with the two outside forwards or wingers functioning as forwards high up the pitch keeping possession of the ball and always looking to cross the ball to the central striker making runs into the box or looking to find a pass to the most forward midfielder making a run in behind the opposing defense from the midfield with the right winger sitting slightly further back but who would often drop off into deeper midfield roles when possession was lost the team would often sit back and defend during matches which enabled them to overcome stronger teams or physically fitter opponents successfully in his book inverting the pyramid jonathan wilson notes that the verrou is best understood as a development from the old rather than the centrehalf dropping in between the two fullbacks as in the wm the two winghalves fell back to flank them they retained an attacking role but their primary function was to combat the opposition wingers the two fullbacks then became in effect central defenders playing initially almost alongside each other although in practice if the opposition attacked down their right the left of the two would move towards the ball with the right covering just behind and vice versa in theory that always left them with a spare manthe verouller as the swiss press of the time called him or the libro as he would becomeat the back wilson notes that a weakness of the verrou system was that it placed excessive demands on the centrehalf as the player deployed in this role was required to attack and act as a playmaker when on the ball while instead dropping back into the defence acting almost as a centreback off the ball however with this system rappan won two league titles with servette and five more with grasshopper after joining the club in during his time with soviet club krylya sovetov kuybyshev in the s alexander kuzmich abramov also used a similar defensive tactic known as the volzhskaya zashchepka or the volga clip unlike the verrou his system was not as flexible and was a development of the or wm rather than the but it also featured one of the halfbacks dropping deep this allowed the defensive centrehalf to sweep in behind the fullbacks essentially acting as a sweeper in spain starting in the s and reaching great success in the s helenio herrera developed an early version of his s catenaccio with atltico madrid he won two consecutive league titles with a defence nicknamed the iron curtain he kept on developing his system later on in other spanish clubs until reaching his wellknown formation when he went years later to inter in italy see below italian catenaccio also has its roots with mario villini of triestina in the season ottavio barbieri of spezia in the campionato alta italia and gipo viani of salernitana in the season mezzo sistema was influenced by rappans verrou and originated from an idea that one of the clubs players altered the english wm system known as the sistema in italy by having his centrehalfback known as the centromediano metodista or metodista in italy retreat into the defensive line to act as an additional defender and mark an opposing centreforward instead leaving his fullback which at the time was similar to the modern centreback role free to function as what was essentially a sweeper or libero free in italian although this ultradefensive strategy was initially criticised by members of the italian press including journalist gianni brera andrea schianchi of la gazzetta dello sport notes that this modification was designed to help smaller teams in italy as the mantoman system often put players directly against one another favouring the larger and wealthier teams with stronger individual players in the season ottavio barbieri introduced the sweeper role to italian football during his time as genoas manager he was influenced by rappans verrou and made several alterations to the english wm system or sistema which led to his system being described as mezzosistema gipo viani after him called this vianema his system used a manmarking backline with three manmarking defenders and a fullback who was described as a terzino volante or vagante as noted at the time by former footballer and gazzetta dello sport journalist renzo de vecchi the latter position was essentially a libero the teams midfield played in a triangular shape with the centrehalfback or metodista fielded in front of the backline his formation also made use of three forwards in attacking trident but the rightsided winger was also tasked with assisting the midfield defensively and therefore acted in the manner of a rightsided wide midfielder known as the tornante in italian football italian catenaccio in the late s nereo roccos padova pioneered a modified catenaccio tactics in italy where it would be used again by other italian teams throughout the s his strategy was initially also known as the mezzosistema as like the vianema it modified elements of the sistema roccos tactic often referred to as the real catenaccio was shown first in with triestina the most common mode of operation was a formation with a strictly defensive team approach while his team would look to score by starting quick counterattacks with long balls after winning back possession with catenaccio triestina finished the serie a tournament in a surprising second place some variations include and formations he later had great success with milan using the catenaccio system during the s and s winning several titles including two serie a titles three coppa italia titles two european cups two european cup winners cups and an intercontinental cup alfredo foni also used the catenaccio tactic successfully with inter during the early s unlike rocco however the teamss strong defensive play off the ball did not limit the offensive manner in which his team played while in possession of the ball in his system his teams right winger gino armano would drop back to mark the opposing teams left winger essentially acting as a tornante allowing ivano blason the rightback to shift across and act as a sweeper and clear balls away blason also played as a sweeper under rocco as such he is often considered to be the first true sweeper in italian football the key innovation of catenaccio was the introduction of the role of a libero free defender also called sweeper who was positioned behind a line of three defenders the sweepers role was to recover loose balls nullify the opponents striker and doublemark when necessary another important innovation was the counterattack mainly based on long passes from the defence in helenio herreras version of catenaccio in the s he used a formation in which four manmarking defenders were tightly assigned to the opposing attackers while an extra player the sweeper would pick up any loose ball that escaped the coverage of the defenders the emphasis of this system in italian football spawned the rise of many top italian defenders who became known for their hardtackling and ruthless defending however despite the defensive connotations herrera claimed shortly before his death that the system was more attacking than people remembered saying the problem is that most of the people who copied me copied me wrongly they forgot to include the attacking principles that my catenaccio included i had picchi as a sweeper yes but i also had facchetti the first full back to score as many goals as a forward indeed although his grande inter side were known primarily for their defensive strength they were equally renowned for their ability to score goals with few touches from fast sudden counterattacks due to herreras innovative use of attacking overlapping fullbacks under herrera inter enjoyed a highly successful spell which saw them win three serie a titles two european cups and two intercontinental cups manager ferruccio valcareggi also used tactics inspired by the italian catenaccio system which was popularised by inter manager herrera during the s with the italy national team employing a sweeper behind two manmarking central defenders and a fullback as well as a strategy which made use of heavy defending focussing predominantly on stability grinding out results while conceding few goals and defending narrow leads although his tactics were controversial in particular as during the world cup in mexico he devised his infamous staffetta relay policy of playing one of his two star playmakers sandro mazzola and gianni rivera in each half to avoid offsetting the defensive balance within his team and not particularly exciting they proved to be effective moreover although at times he drew criticism in the italian media over italys dull slow gameplay and lack of goals italy also demonstrated their offensive capabilities throughout the tournament as well as their technical capabilities which enabled them to conserve energy and cope with the altitude in mexico he had a successful spell as italys manager winning uefa euro on home soil and leading italy to the world cup final however in the latter match italy suffered a heavy defeat to a much more offensive minded and stylish brazilian side his team adopted a more attractive playing style in the leadup to the world cup however which saw them considered among the favourites to win but suffered a surprising firstround elimination in the final tournament decline of catenaccio with the advent of total football and the birth of zona mista jock steins celtic defeated the catenaccio system in the european cup final with a highly offensive strategy they beat herreras inter milan on may creating the blue print for rinus michels total football a continuation of steins free flowing attacking football total football which was invented by dutch manager rinus michels in the s exposed the weaknesses of the catenaccio system unlike previous systems in total football no outfield player is fixed in their nominal role anyone can assume in the field the duties of an attacker a midfielder or a defender depending on the play due to players often switching positions with one another manmarking strategies such as catenaccio were no longer effective at coping with this fluid system despite previously losing out to milan in the european cup final who were managed by rocco a manager known for his defensive catenaccio strategy in michels ajax defeated inter in the european cup final and dutch newspapers announced the destruction of catenaccio at the hands of total football the following year ajax defeated cesare maldinis milan in the second leg of the european super cup in a match in which the defensive catenaccio system employed by milan was unable to stop ajax which saw the dutch side win the title on aggregate this was the worst defeat for an italian team in an uefa competition final as manmarking alone was insufficient to cope with the fluidity of total football coaches consequently began to create a new tactical system that mixed manmarking with zonal defence in order to counter this strategy which came to be known as zona mista mixed zone in italian or gioco allitaliana gameplay in the italian manner in italian in italian football as it mixed elements of italian catenaccio manmarking with elements of total football zonal marking italian manager giovanni trapattoni who had played under rocco at milan and was initially influenced by roccos catenaccio system was one of the main proponents of this system from the s onwards and used it to great success modern use of catenaccio derivative defensive strategies highly defensive structures with little attacking intent which are colloquially often referred to as antifootball or parking the bus and which have been employed at times by managers such as jos mourinho and diego simeone are often arbitrarily and incorrectly labelled as catenaccio by pundits managers and players but this deviates from the original design of the system while catenaccio was similarly an organised system that involved tactical discipline and deep heavy and patient defending off or even behind the ball it also made use of now obsolete mantoman marking a sweeper who was tasked with protecting the backline and also starting plays after winning back possession as well as employing sudden counterattacks to score goals italian football although catenaccio has still come to be associated with the italy national side and italian club teams due to its historic association with italian football it is actually used quite infrequently by serie a and italy national teams in contemporary football who instead currently prefer to apply balanced tactics and formations mostly using the or system for example under manager cesare prandelli the italy national team also initially used the formation which had been popularised by juventus manager antonio conte throughout the previous serie a season following his success in the league although prandelli used a ballplaying sweeper he also used attacking wingbacks and a more offensiveminded approach with italy in their first two clashes of uefa euro group c the system resulted in two draws against spain and croatia he subsequently switched to a stylish attacking possessionbased system using their standard diamond formation for the knockout stages the switch proved to be effective as the team went on to reach the final where they suffered defeat to a similarly more offensiveminded spain side who used a possessionbased strategy based on passing known as tikitaka rob smyth of the guardian was critical of spains strikerless formation and particular brand of tikitaka at uefa euro however believing that the lack of emphasis on the offensive aspect of the game led to fewer goals and that the teams seemingly endless passing and preoccupation with ballpossession was in fact boring dubbing it tikitakanaccio a reference to the defensiveminded catenaccio tactical system despite the fact that tikitaka had ironically originated from the more offensive minded dutch total football strategy prandelli did make use of a more organised and defensive formation against spain during the fifa confederations cup semifinal however attempting to stifle spains possession game by reducing spaces and subsequently hitting them on the counterattack the system proved to be more effective as italy created several opportunities and were only eliminated on penalties following a goalless draw several of italys previous coaches such as cesare maldini and giovanni trapattoni used elements of catenaccio to a greater extent at international level and both failed to go far in the tournaments in which they took part under maldini italy lost on penalties to hosts france in the fifa world cup quarterfinals following a draw while trapattoni lost early in the second round of the fifa world cup to cohosts south korea on a golden goal and subsequently suffered a firstround elimination at uefa euro other italian managers have often deviated from the catenaccio system despite still employing aspects of the strategy into their gameplay and maintaining a strong defensive unit while dino zoffs system initially largely differed from the more defensiveminded approach of his predecessors who were in charge of the italy national side by introducing younger players and adopting a more attractive and offensiveminded approach he also made use of a sweeper a tight backline and put catenaccio to good use for italy in the semifinal of uefa euro against cohosts netherlands when the team went down to ten men despite coming under criticism in the media for his defensive playing style during the match following a penalty shootout victory after a draw he secured a place in the final in the final italy only lost on the golden goal rule to france previously azeglio vicini on the other hand had led italy to the semifinals of both uefa euro and the fifa world cup on home soil thanks to a more attractive offensiveminded possession based system which was combined with a solid backline and elements of the italian zona mista mixed zone in italian approach or gioco allitaliana which was a cross between zonal marking and manmarking systems such as catenaccio despite their more aggressive attacking approach under vicini during the latter tournament italy initially struggled in the first round before recovering their form in the knockout stages and produced small wins in five hardfought games against defensive sides in which they scored little but risked even less totalling only seven goals for and none against leading up to the semifinals of the competition italy would then lose a tight semifinal on penalties following a draw with argentina due in no small part to a more defensive strategy from carlos bilardo who then went on to lose the final to a much more offensiveminded germany side led by manager franz beckenbauer italy then claimed the bronze medal match with a victory over england vicinis successor as the italy national sides manager arrigo sacchi also attempted to introduce his more attackingminded tactical philosophy which had been highly successful with milan to the italy national team his tactics which were inspired by dutch total football made use of an aggressive highpressing system which used a formation an attractive fast attacking and possessionbased playing style and which also used innovative elements such as zonal marking and a high defensive line playing the offside trap which largely deviated from previous systems in italian football despite still maintaining defensive solidity italy initially struggled to replicate the system successfully however and encountered mixed results under sacchi italy reached the final of the fifa world cup after a slow start only to lose on penalties following a draw with a defensiveminded brazilian side but later also suffered a firstround exit at euro previously at the fifa world cup enzo bearzots italian side also often adopted an attractive offensiveminded possession game based on passing creativity movement attacking flair and technique due to the individual skill of his players the front three would also often change positions with one another in order to disorient the opposing defenders italy finished the tournament in fourth place a result they replicated two years later at uefa euro on home soil at the fifa world cup he instead adopted a more flexible and balanced tactical approach which was based on the zona mista system and which used a fluid formation with gaetano scirea as a sweeper who held both defensive and creative duties while the team were organised and highly effective defensively they were also capable of getting forward and scoring from quick counterattacks or keeping possession when necessary the system proved to be highly effective as italy went on to win the title bearzots italy side were also known for their solidity aggression and defensive strength possessing a number of hardtackling players in their team such as midfielder marco tardelli and defenders claudio gentile and giuseppe bergomi gentile who served as the teams stopper or manmarking centreback gained a degree of infamy in the media for his highly physical manmarking of diego maradona in italys secondround match against argentina although controversial the strategy proved to be effective as gentile essentially nullified the argentine playmakers impact on the game with italy winning the match similarly although italy successfully used a more offensiveminded approach under manager marcello lippi during the fifa world cup which saw a record ten of the teams players find the back of the net with the side scoring goals in total as they went on to claim the title the teams organised backline only conceded two goals neither of which came in open play notwithstanding their more attacking minded playing style throughout the tournament when italy was reduced to ten men in the th minute of the nd round match against australia following marco materazzis red card coach lippi changed the italians formation to a defensive orientation which caused the british newspaper the guardian to note that the timidity of italys approach had made it seem that helenio herrera the high priest of catenaccio had taken possession of the soul of marcello lippi the tenman team was playing with a scheme just a midfielder away from the teams regular system in a tightlycontested match italy went on to keep a clean sheet and earned a victory through a controversial injurytime penalty during his tenure with the italy national team conte returned to italys traditional tactical roots adopting a more organised defensiveminded counterattacking approach due to the perceived lack of talent in the side at the time as well as injuries to key players he used a fluid formation at uefa euro in which the wide midfielders or wingbacks effectively functioned as wingers in a formation when attacking and as fullbacks in a formation when defending behind the ball contes tactics proved to be effective as italy reached the quarterfinals only losing out to germany on penalties however despite the teams defensive solidity he refuted claims in the media that the teams style of play was based on catenaccio in particular following italys offensive displays in their victory over defending champions spain in the round of during italys victorious uefa euro campaign roberto mancini who once had a reputation for being a more defensiveminded and pragmatic manager instead built on the work of maurizio viscidi at youth level as well as maurizio sarri roberto de zerbi and gian piero gasperini in serie a using a formation and an attractive attacking style based on fluid passing in possession built around the gameplay of the midfield trio of marco verratti jorginho and nicol barella and energetic pressing and counterpressing out of possession en route to winning the title mancinis side broke the record for most goals scored by an italian side during a major international tournament other examples however catenaccio in its purer form has also had its share of success stories in recent years german coach otto rehhagel used a similarly defensive approach for his greece side in uefa euro with the team defending deeply behind the ball and putting pressure on their opponents while traianos dellas operated as a sweeper behind the backline under rehhagel greece surprisingly went on to win the tournament despite greece being considered as underdogs prior to the competition despite strong emphasis on defence only one greek game went into extra time which the greeks won with a golden goal by traianos dellas trapattoni himself also successfully employed aspects of the system in securing a portuguese liga title with benfica in the clubs first in years and had also successfully used elements of the strategy in his gioco allitaliana or zona mista tactical system with several italian clubs throughout his career which blended aspects of zonal marking from dutch total football with aspects of manmarking found in italian catenaccio in contrast to previous editions of the tournament during the fifa world cup several teams found success against opponents who dominated possession by adopting a more defensive style and instead maintaining a deep disciplined and narrow defensive line while also looking to score on counterattacks legacy although pure catenaccio is no longer as commonplace in italian football the stereotypical association of ruthless defensive tactics with the serie a and the italy national team continues to be perpetuated by foreign media particularly with the predominantly italian defences of ac milan of the s and juventus from the s onwards being in the spotlight rob bagchi wrote in british newspaper the guardian italy has also produced defenders with a surplus of ability composure and intelligence for every gentile there was an alessandro nesta critics and foreign footballers who have played in the serie a have described italian defenders as being masters of the dark arts motivated by a machiavellian philosophy of winning a game at all costs by cunning and calculating methods historian john foot summed up the mentality the tactics are a combination of subtlety and brutality the tactical foul is a way of life for italian defenders see also zona mista formation association football football tactics and skills total football antifootball marking association
